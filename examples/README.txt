New to Dear ImGui?
- Check out the Getting Started guide: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started
- About Backends: docs/BACKENDS.md file, or on the web: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/BACKENDS.md
- About Examples: docs/EXAMPLES.md file, or on the web: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/EXAMPLES.md

Backends = Helper code to facilitate integration with platforms/graphics api (used by Examples + should be used by your app).
Examples = Standalone applications showcasing integration with platforms/graphics api.

A few Examples have extra README files in their respective directory, please check them too!

Once Dear ImGui is running (in either examples or your own application/game/engine),
run and refer to ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() in imgui_demo.cpp for the end-user API.
