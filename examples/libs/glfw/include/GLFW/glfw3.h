 *   - Names of printable alpha-numeric characters are used (e.g. "A", "R",
 *     "3", etc.)
 *   - For non-alphanumeric characters, Unicode:ish names are used (e.g.
 *     "COMMA", "LEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET", etc.). Note that some names do not
 *     correspond to the Unicode standard (usually for brevity)
 *   - Keys that lack a clear US mapping are named "WORLD_x"
 *   - For non-printable keys, custom names are used (e.g. "F4",
 *     "BACKSPACE", etc.)

 *
 *  Successful creation does not change which context is current.  Before you

 *  [make it current](@ref context_current).  For information about the `share`
 *  parameter, see @ref context_sharing.
 *
 *  The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you
 *  requested, as not all parameters and hints are
 *  [hard constraints](@ref window_hints_hard).  This includes the size of the

 *  of the created window, framebuffer and context, see @ref
 *  glfwGetWindowAttrib, @ref glfwGetWindowSize and @ref glfwGetFramebufferSize.
 *
 *  To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window
 *  will cover.  If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
 *  Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is
 *  recommended that you pick the primary monitor.  For more information on how
 *  to query connected monitors, see @ref monitor_monitors.
 *
 *  For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the
 *  window's _desired video mode_.  As long as a full screen window is not
 *  iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video
 *  mode is set for the specified monitor.  For more information about full
 *  screen windows, including the creation of so called _windowed full screen_
 *  or _borderless full screen_ windows, see @ref window_windowed_full_screen.
 *
 *  Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and
 *  full screen mode with @ref glfwSetWindowMonitor.  This will not affect its
 *  OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.
 *
 *  By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the
 *  window system.  To create the window at a specific position, make it
 *  initially invisible using the [GLFW_VISIBLE](@ref GLFW_VISIBLE_hint) window
 *  hint, set its [position](@ref window_pos) and then [show](@ref window_hide)
 *  it.
 *
 *  As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver
 *  is prohibited from starting.
 *
 *  Window systems put limits on window sizes.  Very large or very small window
 *  dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation.  Check the

 *  the `IDI_APPLICATION` icon will be used instead.  To set a different icon,
 *  see @ref glfwSetWindowIcon.
 *
 *  @remark @win32 The context to share resources with must not be current on
 *  any other thread.
 *
 *  @remark @macos The OS only supports forward-compatible core profile contexts
 *  for OpenGL versions 3.2 and later.  Before creating an OpenGL context of
 *  version 3.2 or later you must set the
 *  [GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT](@ref GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT_hint) and
 *  [GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE](@ref GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE_hint) hints accordingly.
 *  OpenGL 3.0 and 3.1 contexts are not supported at all on macOS.
 *
 *  @remark @macos The GLFW window has no icon, as it is not a document
 *  window, but the dock icon will be the same as the application bundle's icon.
 *  For more information on bundles, see the
 *  [Bundle Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/)
 *  in the Mac Developer Library.
 *
 *  @remark @macos The first time a window is created the menu bar is created.
 *  If GLFW finds a `MainMenu.nib` it is loaded and assumed to contain a menu
 *  bar.  Otherwise a minimal menu bar is created manually with common commands
 *  like Hide, Quit and About.  The About entry opens a minimal about dialog
 *  with information from the application's bundle.  Menu bar creation can be
 *  disabled entirely with the @ref GLFW_COCOA_MENUBAR init hint.
 *
 *  @remark @macos On OS X 10.10 and later the window frame will not be rendered
 *  at full resolution on Retina displays unless the

 *  hint is `GLFW_TRUE` and the `NSHighResolutionCapable` key is enabled in the

 *  [High Resolution Guidelines for OS X](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Explained/Explained.html)
 *  in the Mac Developer Library.  The GLFW test and example programs use
 *  a custom `Info.plist` template for this, which can be found as
 *  `CMake/MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in` in the source tree.
 *
 *  @remark @macos When activating frame autosaving with
 *  [GLFW_COCOA_FRAME_NAME](@ref GLFW_COCOA_FRAME_NAME_hint), the specified
 *  window size and position may be overriden by previously saved values.
 *
 *  @remark @x11 Some window managers will not respect the placement of
 *  initially hidden windows.
 *
 *  @remark @x11 Due to the asynchronous nature of X11, it may take a moment for
 *  a window to reach its requested state.  This means you may not be able to
 *  query the final size, position or other attributes directly after window
 *  creation.
 *
 *  @remark @x11 The class part of the `WM_CLASS` window property will by
 *  default be set to the window title passed to this function.  The instance
 *  part will use the contents of the `RESOURCE_NAME` environment variable, if
 *  present and not empty, or fall back to the window title.  Set the
 *  [GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME](@ref GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME_hint) and
 *  [GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME](@ref GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME_hint) window hints to
 *  override this.
 *
 *  @remark @wayland Compositors should implement the xdg-decoration protocol
 *  for GLFW to decorate the window properly.  If this protocol isn't
 *  supported, or if the compositor prefers client-side decorations, a very
 *  simple fallback frame will be drawn using the wp_viewporter protocol.  A
 *  compositor can still emit close, maximize or fullscreen events, using for
 *  instance a keybind mechanism.  If neither of these protocols is supported,
 *  the window won't be decorated.
 *
 *  @remark @wayland A full screen window will not attempt to change the mode,

 *
 *  If Vulkan or the required window surface creation instance extensions are
 *  not available on the machine, or if the specified instance was not created
 *  with the required extensions, this function returns `GLFW_FALSE` and
 *  generates a @ref GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE error.  Call @ref glfwVulkanSupported
 *  to check whether Vulkan is at least minimally available and @ref
 *  glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions to check what instance extensions are
 *  required.
 *
 *  @param[in] instance The instance that the physical device belongs to.
 *  @param[in] device The physical device that the queue family belongs to.
 *  @param[in] queuefamily The index of the queue family to query.
 *  @return `GLFW_TRUE` if the queue family supports presentation, or
 *  `GLFW_FALSE` otherwise.
 *
 *  @errors Possible errors include @ref GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, @ref
 *  GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE and @ref GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.
 *
 *  @remark @macos This function currently always returns `GLFW_TRUE`, as the
 *  `VK_MVK_macos_surface` extension does not provide
 *  a `vkGetPhysicalDevice*PresentationSupport` type function.
 *
 *  @thread_safety This function may be called from any thread.  For

/*! @brief Creates a Vulkan surface for the specified window.
 *
 *  This function creates a Vulkan surface for the specified window.
 *
 *  If the Vulkan loader or at least one minimally functional ICD were not found,
 *  this function returns `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` and generates a @ref
 *  GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE error.  Call @ref glfwVulkanSupported to check whether
 *  Vulkan is at least minimally available.
 *
 *  If the required window surface creation instance extensions are not
 *  available or if the specified instance was not created with these extensions
 *  enabled, this function returns `VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT` and
 *  generates a @ref GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE error.  Call @ref
 *  glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions to check what instance extensions are
 *  required.
 *
 *  The window surface cannot be shared with another API so the window must
 *  have been created with the [client api hint](@ref GLFW_CLIENT_API_attrib)
 *  set to `GLFW_NO_API` otherwise it generates a @ref GLFW_INVALID_VALUE error
 *  and returns `VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR`.
 *
 *  The window surface must be destroyed before the specified Vulkan instance.
 *  It is the responsibility of the caller to destroy the window surface.  GLFW
 *  does not destroy it for you.  Call `vkDestroySurfaceKHR` to destroy the
 *  surface.
 *
 *  @param[in] instance The Vulkan instance to create the surface in.
 *  @param[in] window The window to create the surface for.
 *  @param[in] allocator The allocator to use, or `NULL` to use the default
 *  allocator.
 *  @param[out] surface Where to store the handle of the surface.  This is set
 *  to `VK_NULL_HANDLE` if an error occurred.
 *  @return `VK_SUCCESS` if successful, or a Vulkan error code if an
 *  [error](@ref error_handling) occurred.
 *
 *  @errors Possible errors include @ref GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, @ref
 *  GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE, @ref GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR and @ref GLFW_INVALID_VALUE
 *
 *  @remark If an error occurs before the creation call is made, GLFW returns
 *  the Vulkan error code most appropriate for the error.  Appropriate use of
 *  @ref glfwVulkanSupported and @ref glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions should
 *  eliminate almost all occurrences of these errors.
 *
 *  @remark @macos This function currently only supports the
 *  `VK_MVK_macos_surface` extension from MoltenVK.
 *
 *  @remark @macos This function creates and sets a `CAMetalLayer` instance for
 *  the window content view, which is required for MoltenVK to function.
 *
 *  @thread_safety This function may be called from any thread.  For
 *  synchronization details of Vulkan objects, see the Vulkan specification.
