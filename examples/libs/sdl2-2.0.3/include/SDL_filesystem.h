/**
 * \brief Get the user-and-app-specific path where files can be written.
 *
 * Get the "pref dir". This is meant to be where users can write personal
 *  files (preferences and save games, etc) that are specific to your
 *  application. This directory is unique per user, per application.
 *
 * This function will decide the appropriate location in the native filesystem,
 *  create the directory if necessary, and return a string of the absolute
 *  path to the directory in UTF-8 encoding.
 *
 * On Windows, the string might look like:
 *  "C:\\Users\\bob\\AppData\\Roaming\\My Company\\My Program Name\\"
 *
 * On Linux, the string might look like:
 *  "/home/bob/.local/share/My Program Name/"
 *
 * On Mac OS X, the string might look like:
 *  "/Users/bob/Library/Application Support/My Program Name/"
 *
 * (etc.)
 *
 * You specify the name of your organization (if it's not a real organization,
 *  your name or an Internet domain you own might do) and the name of your
 *  application. These should be untranslated proper names.
 *
 * Both the org and app strings may become part of a directory name, so
 *  please follow these rules:
 *
 *    - Try to use the same org string (including case-sensitivity) for
 *      all your applications that use this function.
 *    - Always use a unique app string for each one, and make sure it never
 *      changes for an app once you've decided on it.
 *    - Unicode characters are legal, as long as it's UTF-8 encoded, but...
 *    - ...only use letters, numbers, and spaces. Avoid punctuation like
 *      "Game Name 2: Bad Guy's Revenge!" ... "Game Name 2" is sufficient.
 *
 * This returns an absolute path in UTF-8 encoding, and is guaranteed to
 *  end with a path separator ('\\' on Windows, '/' most other places).
 *
 * The pointer returned by this function is owned by you. Please call
 *  SDL_free() on the pointer when you are done with it, or it will be a
 *  memory leak. This is not necessarily a fast call, though, so you should
 *  call this once near startup and save the string if you need it.
 *
 * You should assume the path returned by this function is the only safe
 *  place to write files (and that SDL_GetBasePath(), while it might be
 *  writable, or even the parent of the returned path, aren't where you
 *  should be writing things).
 *
 * Some platforms can't determine the pref path, and on other
 *  platforms, this might be meaningless. In such cases, this function will
 *  return NULL.
 *
 *   \param org The name of your organization.
 *   \param app The name of your application.
 *  \return UTF-8 string of user dir in platform-dependent notation. NULL
 *          if there's a problem (creating directory failed, etc).
