# iOS / OSX Metal example

## Introduction

This example shows how to integrate Dear ImGui with Metal. It is based on the "cross-platform" game template provided
with Xcode as of Xcode 9.

Consider basing your work off the example_glfw_metal/ or example_sdl2_metal/ examples. They are better supported and
will be portable unlike this one.
