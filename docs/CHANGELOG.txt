CHANGELOG

This document holds the user-facing changelog that we also use in release notes.
We generally fold multiple commits pertaining to the same topic as a single entry.
Changes to the examples/bindings are included within the individual .cpp files in the examples/ folder.

RELEASE NOTES:                  https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases
REPORT ISSUES, ASK QUESTIONS:   https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues
COMMITS HISTORY:                https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/commits/master

WHEN TO UPDATE?

- Keeping your copy of dear imgui updated once in a while is recommended.
- It is generally safe to sync to the latest commit in master.
  The library is fairly stable and regressions tends to be fixed fast when reported.

HOW TO UPDATE?

- Overwrite every file except imconfig.h (if you have modified it).
- You may also locally branch to modify imconfig.h and merge latest into your branch.
- Read the `Breaking Changes` section (in imgui.cpp or here in the Changelog).
- If you have a problem with a missing function/symbols, search for its name in the code, there will likely be a comment about it.
- If you are dropping this repository in your codebase, please leave the demo and text files in there, they will be useful.
- You may diff your previous Changelog with the one you just copied and read that diff.
- You may enable `IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` in imconfig.h to forcefully disable legacy names and symbols.
  Doing it every once in a while is a good way to make sure you are not using obsolete symbols. Dear ImGui is in active development,
  and API updates have been a little more frequent lately. They are documented below and in imgui.cpp and should not affect all users.
- Please report any issue!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.74 WIP (In Progress)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:
- Removed redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.52 (October 2017):
  - Begin() [old 5 args version]     -> use Begin() [3 args], use SetNextWindowSize() SetNextWindowBgAlpha() if needed
  - IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered()  -> use IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootAndChildWindows)
  - AlignFirstTextHeightToWidgets()  -> use AlignTextToFramePadding()
  - SetNextWindowPosCenter()         -> use SetNextWindowPos() with a pivot of (0.5f, 0.5f)
  - ImFont::Glyph                    -> use ImFontGlyph
  If you were still using the old names, read "API Breaking Changes" section of imgui.cpp to find out
  the new names or equivalent features, or see how they were implemented until 1.73.
- Inputs: Fixed a miscalculation in the keyboard/mouse "typematic" repeat delay/rate calculation, used
  by keys and e.g. repeating mouse buttons as well as the GetKeyPressedAmount() function.
  If you were using a non-default value for io.KeyRepeatRate (previous default was 0.250), you can
  add +io.KeyRepeatDelay to it to compensate for the fix.
  The function was triggering on: 0.0 and (delay+rate*N) where (N>=1). Fixed formula responds to (N>=0).
  Effectively it made io.KeyRepeatRate behave like it was set to (io.KeyRepeatRate + io.KeyRepeatDelay).
  Fixed the code and altered default io.KeyRepeatRate,Delay from 0.250,0.050 to 0.300,0.050 to compensate.
  If you never altered io.KeyRepeatRate nor used GetKeyPressedAmount() this won't affect you.
- Backends: DX12: Added extra ID3D12DescriptorHeap parameter to ImGui_ImplDX12_Init() function.
  The value is unused in master branch but will be used by the multi-viewport feature. (#2851) [@obfuscate]

Other Changes:
- InputText, Nav: Fixed Home/End key broken when activating Keyboard Navigation. (#787)
- InputText: Filter out ASCII 127 (DEL) emitted by low-level OSX layer, as we are using the Key value. (#2578)
- Layout: Fixed a couple of subtle bounding box vertical positioning issues relating to the handling of text
  baseline alignment. The issue would generally manifest when laying out multiple items on a same line,
  with varying heights and text baseline offsets.
  Some specific examples, e.g. a button with regular frame padding followed by another item with a
  multi-line label and no frame padding, such as: multi-line text, small button, tree node item, etc.
  The second item was correctly offset to match text baseline, and would interact/display correctly,
  but it wouldn't push the contents area boundary low enough.
- ColorPicker: Fixed SV triangle gradient to block (broken in 1.73). (#2864, #2711). [@lewa-j]
- TreeNode: Fixed combination of ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanFullWidth and ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_OpenOnArrow
  incorrectly locating the arrow hit position to the left of the frame. (#2451, #2438, #1897)
- DragScalar, SliderScalar, InputScalar: Added p_ prefix to parameter that are pointers to the data
  to clarify how they are used, and more comments redirecting to the demo code. (#2844)
- Misc: Optimized storage of window settings data (reducing allocation count).
- Misc: Windows: Do not use _wfopen() if IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_FUNCTIONS is defined. (#2815)
- Docs: Improved and moved FAQ to docs/FAQ.md so it can be readable on the web. [@ButternCream, @ocornut]
- Docs: Added permanent redirect from https://www.dearimgui.org/faq to FAQ page.
- Demo: Added simple item reordering demo in Widgets -> Drag and Drop section. (#2823, #143) [@rokups]
- Metrics: Expose basic details of each window key/value state storage.
- Examples: DX12: Using IDXGIDebug1::ReportLiveObjects() when DX12_ENABLE_DEBUG_LAYER is enabled.
- Examples: Emscripten: Removed NO_FILESYSTEM from Makefile, seems to fail on some setup. (#2734) [@Funto]
- Examples: Emscripten: Removed BINARYEN_TRAP_MODE=clamp from Makefile which was removed in Emscripten 1.39.0
  but required prior to 1.39.0, making life easier for absolutely no-one. (#2877, #2878) [@podsvirov]
- Backends: OpenGL3: Fix building with pre-3.2 GL loaders which do not expose glDrawElementsBaseVertex(),
  using runtime GL version to decide if we set ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset. (#2866, #2852) [@dpilawa]
- Backends: OSX: Fix using Backspace key. (#2578, #2817, #2818) [@DiligentGraphics]
- Backends: GLFW: Previously installed user callbacks are now restored on shutdown. (#2836) [@malte-v]
- CI: Set up a bunch of continuous-integration tests using GitHub Actions. We now compile many of the example
  applications on Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Emscripten. Removed Travis integration. (#2865) [@rokups]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.73 (Released 2019-09-24)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Changes:

- Nav, Scrolling: Added support for Home/End key. (#787)
- ColorEdit: Disable Hue edit when Saturation==0 instead of letting Hue values jump around.
- ColorEdit, ColorPicker: In HSV display of a RGB stored value, attempt to locally preserve Hue
  when Saturation==0, which reduces accidentally lossy interactions. (#2722, 2770) [@rokups]
- ColorPicker: Made rendering aware of global style alpha of the picker can be faded out. (#2711)
  Note that some elements won't accurately fade down with the same intensity, and the color wheel
  when enabled will have small overlap glitches with (style.Alpha < 1.0).
- TabBar: Fixed single-tab not shrinking their width down.
- TabBar: Fixed clicking on a tab larger than tab-bar width creating a bouncing feedback loop.
- TabBar: Feed desired width (sum of unclipped tabs width) into layout system to allow for auto-resize. (#2768)
  (before 1.71 tab bars fed the sum of current width which created feedback loops in certain situations).
- TabBar: Improved shrinking for large number of tabs to avoid leaving extraneous space on the right side.
  Individuals tabs are given integer-rounded width and remainder is spread between tabs left-to-right.
- Columns, Separator: Fixed a bug where non-visible separators within columns would alter the next row position
  differently than visible ones.
- SliderScalar: Improved assert when using U32 or U64 types with a large v_max value. (#2765) [@loicmouton]
- DragInt, DragFloat, DragScalar: Using (v_min > v_max) allows locking any edits to the value.
- DragScalar: Fixed dragging of unsigned values on ARM cpu (float to uint cast is undefined). (#2780) [@dBagrat]
- TreeNode: Added ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanAvailWidth flag. (#2451, #2438, #1897) [@Melix19, @PathogenDavid]
  This extends the hit-box to the right-most edge, even if the node is not framed.
  (Note: this is not the default in order to allow adding other items on the same line. In the future we will
  aim toward refactoring the hit-system to be front-to-back, allowing more natural overlapping of items,
  and then we will be able to make this the default.)
- TreeNode: Added ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_SpanFullWidth flag. This extends the hit-box to both the left-most and
  right-most edge of the working area, bypassing indentation.
- CollapsingHeader: Added support for ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_Bullet and ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_Leaf on framed nodes,
  mostly for consistency. (#2159, #2160) [@goran-w]
- Selectable: Added ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowItemOverlap flag in public api (was previously internal only).
- Style: Allow style.WindowMenuButtonPosition to be set to ImGuiDir_None to hide the collapse button. (#2634, #2639)
- Font: Better ellipsis ("...") drawing implementation. Instead of drawing three pixel-ey dots (which was glaringly
  unfitting with many types of fonts) we first attempt to find a standard ellipsis glyphs within the loaded set.
  Otherwise we render ellipsis using '.' from the font from where we trim excessive spacing to make it as narrow
  as possible. (#2775) [@rokups]
- ImDrawList: Clarified the name of many parameters so reading the code is a little easier. (#2740)
- ImDrawListSplitter: Fixed merging channels if the last submitted draw command used a different texture. (#2506)
- Using offsetof() when available in C++11. Avoids Clang sanitizer complaining about old-style macros. (#94)
- ImVector: Added find(), find_erase(), find_erase_unsorted() helpers.
- Added a mechanism to compact/free the larger allocations of unused windows (buffers are compacted when
  a window is unused for 60 seconds, as per io.ConfigWindowsMemoryCompactTimer = 60.0f). Note that memory
  usage has never been reported as a problem, so this is merely a touch of overzealous luxury. (#2636)
- Documentation: Various tweaks and improvements to the README page. [@ker0chan]
- Backends: OpenGL3: Tweaked initialization code allow application calling ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_CreateFontsTexture()
  before ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_NewFrame(), which sometimes can be convenient.
- Backends: OpenGL3: Attempt to automatically detect default GL loader by using __has_include. (#2798) [@o-micron]
- Backends: DX11: Fixed GSGetShader() call not passing an initialized instance count, which would
  generally make the DX11 debug layer complain (bug added in 1.72).
- Backends: Vulkan: Added support for specifying multisample count. Set 'ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo::MSAASamples' to
   one of the VkSampleCountFlagBits values to use, default is non-multisampled as before. (#2705, #2706) [@vilya]
- Examples: OSX: Fix example_apple_opengl2/main.mm not forwarding mouse clicks and drags correctly. (#1961, #2710)
  [@intonarumori, @ElectricMagic]
- Misc: Updated stb_rect_pack.h from 0.99 to 1.00 (fixes by @rygorous: off-by-1 bug in best-fit heuristic,
  fix handling of rectangles too large to fit inside texture). (#2762) [@tido64]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.72b (Released 2019-07-31)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Changes:

- Nav, Scrolling: Fixed programmatic scroll leading to a slightly incorrect scroll offset when
  the window has decorations or a menu-bar (broken in 1.71). This was mostly noticeable when
  a keyboard/gamepad movement led to scrolling the view, or using e.g. SetScrollHereY() function.
- Nav: Made hovering non-MenuItem Selectable not re-assign the source item for keyboard navigation.
- Nav: Fixed an issue with NavFlattened window flag (beta) where widgets not entirely fitting
  in child window (often selectables because of their protruding sides) would be not considered
  as entry points to to navigate toward the child window. (#787)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.72 (Released 2019-07-27)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:
- Removed redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.51 (June 2017):
  - ImGuiCol_Column*, ImGuiSetCond_* enums.
  - IsItemHoveredRect(), IsPosHoveringAnyWindow(), IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow(), IsMouseHoveringWindow() functions.
  - IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME macro.
  If you were still using the old names, read "API Breaking Changes" section of imgui.cpp to find out
  the new names or equivalent features.
- Renamed ImFontAtlas::CustomRect to ImFontAtlasCustomRect. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
- Removed TreeAdvanceToLabelPos() which is rarely used and only does SetCursorPosX(GetCursorPosX() + GetTreeNodeToLabelSpacing()).
  Kept redirection function (will obsolete). (#581, #324)

Other Changes:
- Scrolling: Made mouse-wheel scrolling lock the underlying window until the mouse is moved again or
  until a short delay expires (~2 seconds). This allow uninterrupted scroll even if child windows are
  passing under the mouse cursor. (#2604)
- Scrolling: Made it possible for mouse wheel and navigation-triggered scrolling to override a call to
  SetScrollX()/SetScrollY(), making it possible to use a simpler stateless pattern for auto-scrolling:
     // (Submit items..)
     if (ImGui::GetScrollY() >= ImGui::GetScrollMaxY())  // If scrolling at the already at the bottom..
         ImGui::SetScrollHereY(1.0f);                    // ..make last item fully visible
- Scrolling: Added SetScrollHereX(), SetScrollFromPosX() for completeness. (#1580) [@kevreco]
- Scrolling: Mouse wheel scrolling while hovering a child window is automatically forwarded to parent window
  if ScrollMax is zero on the scrolling axis.
  Also still the case if ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollWithMouse is set (not new), but previously the forwarding
  would be disabled if ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollbar was set on the child window, which is not the case
  any more. Forwarding can still be disabled by setting ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs. (amend #1502, #1380).
- Window: Fixed InnerClipRect right-most coordinates using wrong padding setting (introduced in 1.71).
- Window: Fixed old SetWindowFontScale() api value from not being inherited by child window. Added
  comments about the right way to scale your UI (load a font at the right side, rebuild atlas, scale style).
- Scrollbar: Avoid overlapping the opposite side when window (often a child window) is forcibly too small.
- Combo: Hide arrow when there's not enough space even for the square button.
- InputText: Testing for newly added ImGuiKey_KeyPadEnter key. (#2677, #2005) [@amc522]
- TabBar: Fixed unfocused tab bar separator color (was using ImGuiCol_Tab, should use ImGuiCol_TabUnfocusedActive).
- Columns: Fixed a regression from 1.71 where the right-side of the contents rectangle within each column
  would wrongly use a WindowPadding.x instead of ItemSpacing.x like it always did. (#125, #2666)
- Columns: Made the right-most edge reaches up to the clipping rectangle (removing half of WindowPadding.x
  worth of asymmetrical/extraneous padding, note that there's another half that conservatively has to offset
  the right-most column, otherwise it's clipping width won't match the other columns). (#125, #2666)
- Columns: Improved honoring alignment with various values of ItemSpacing.x and WindowPadding.x. (#125, #2666)
- Columns: Made GetColumnOffset() and GetColumnWidth() behave when there's no column set, consistently with
  other column functions. (#2683)
- InputTextMultiline: Fixed vertical scrolling tracking glitch.
- Word-wrapping: Fixed overzealous word-wrapping when glyph edge lands exactly on the limit. Because
  of this, auto-fitting exactly unwrapped text would make it wrap. (fixes initial 1.15 commit, 78645a7d).
- Style: Attenuated default opacity of ImGuiCol_Separator in Classic and Light styles.
- Style: Added style.ColorButtonPosition (left/right, defaults to ImGuiDir_Right) to move the color button
  of ColorEdit3/ColorEdit4 functions to either side of the inputs.
- IO: Added ImGuiKey_KeyPadEnter and support in various back-ends (previously back-ends would need to
  specifically redirect key-pad keys to their regular counterpart). This is a temporary attenuating measure
  until we actually refactor and add whole sets of keys into the ImGuiKey enum. (#2677, #2005) [@amc522]
- Misc: Made Button(), ColorButton() not trigger an "edited" event leading to IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit()
  returning true. This also effectively make ColorEdit4() not incorrect trigger IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit()
  when clicking the color button to open the picker popup. (#1875)
- Misc: Added IMGUI_DISABLE_METRICS_WINDOW imconfig.h setting to explicitly compile out ShowMetricsWindow().
- Debug, Metrics: Added "Tools->Item Picker" tool which allow clicking on a widget to break in the debugger
  within the item code. The tool calls IM_DEBUG_BREAK() which can be redefined in imconfig.h if needed.
- ImDrawList: Fixed CloneOutput() helper crashing. (#1860) [@gviot]
- ImDrawList::ChannelsSplit(), ImDrawListSplitter: Fixed an issue with merging draw commands between
  channel 0 and 1. (#2624)
- ImDrawListSplitter: Fixed memory leak when using low-level split api (was not affecting ImDrawList api,
  also this type was added in 1.71 and not advertised as a public-facing feature).
- Fonts: binary_to_compressed_c.cpp: Display an error message if failing to open/read the input font file.
- Demo: Log, Console: Using a simpler stateless pattern for auto-scrolling.
- Demo: Widgets: Showing how to use the format parameter of Slider/Drag functions to display the name
  of an enum value instead of the underlying integer value.
- Demo: Renamed the "Help" menu to "Tools" (more accurate).
- Backends: DX10/DX11: Backup, clear and restore Geometry Shader is any is bound when calling renderer.
- Backends: DX11: Clear Hull Shader, Domain Shader, Compute Shader before rendering. Not backing/restoring them.
- Backends: OSX: Disabled default native Mac clipboard copy/paste implementation in core library (added in 1.71),
  because it needs application to be linked with '-framework ApplicationServices'. It can be explicitly
  enabled back by using '#define IMGUI_ENABLE_OSX_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCTIONS' in imconfig.h. Re-added
  equivalent using NSPasteboard api in the imgui_impl_osx.mm experimental back-end. (#2546)
- Backends: SDL2: Added dummy ImGui_ImplSDL2_InitForD3D() function to make D3D support more visible.
  (#2482, #2632) [@josiahmanson]
- Examples: Added SDL2+DirectX11 example application. (#2632, #2612, #2482) [@vincenthamm]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.71 (Released 2019-06-12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:
- IO: changed AddInputCharacter(unsigned short c) signature to AddInputCharacter(unsigned int c).
- Renamed SetNextTreeNodeOpen() to SetNextItemOpen(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Window: rendering of child windows outer decorations (e.g. bg color, border, scrollbars) is now
  performed as part of their parent window, avoiding the creation of an extraneous draw commands.
  If you have overlapping child windows with decorations, and relied on their relative z-order to be
  mapped to submission their order, this will affect your rendering. The optimization is disabled
  if the parent window has no visual output because it appears to be the most common situation leading
  to the creation of overlapping child windows. Please reach out if you are affected by this change!

Other Changes:
- Window: clarified behavior of SetNextWindowContentSize(). Content size is defined as the size available
  after removal of WindowPadding on each sides. So SetNextWindowContentSize(ImVec2(100,100)) + auto-resize
  will always allow submitting a 100x100 item without creating a scrollbar, regarding of WindowPadding.
  The exact meaning of ContentSize for decorated windows was previously ill-defined.
- Window: Fixed auto-resize with AlwaysVerticalScrollbar or AlwaysHorizontalScrollbar flags.
- Window: Fixed one case where auto-resize by double-clicking the resize grip would make either scrollbar
  appear for a single frame after the resize.
- Separator: Revert 1.70 "Declare its thickness (1.0f) to the layout" change. It's not incorrect
  but it breaks existing some layout patterns. Will return back to it when we expose Separator flags.
- Fixed InputScalar, InputScalarN, SliderScalarN, DragScalarN with non-visible label from inserting
  style.ItemInnerSpacing.x worth of trailing spacing.
- Fixed InputFloatX, SliderFloatX, DragFloatX functions erroneously reporting IsItemEdited() multiple
  times when the text input doesn't match the formatted output value (e.g. input "1" shows "1.000").
  It wasn't much of a problem because we typically use the return value instead of IsItemEdited() here.
- Fixed uses of IsItemDeactivated(), IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() on multi-components widgets and
  after EndGroup(). (#2550, #1875)
- Fixed crash when appending with BeginMainMenuBar() more than once and no other window are showing. (#2567)
- ColorEdit: Fixed the color picker popup only displaying inputs as HSV instead of showing multiple
  options. (#2587, broken in 1.69 by #2384).
- CollapsingHeader: Better clipping when a close button is enabled and it overlaps the label. (#600)
- Scrollbar: Minor bounding box adjustment to cope with various border size.
- Scrollbar, Style: Changed default style.ScrollbarSize from 16 to 14.
- Combo: Fixed rounding not applying with the ImGuiComboFlags_NoArrowButton flag. (#2607) [@DucaRii]
- Nav: Fixed gamepad/keyboard moving of window affecting contents size incorrectly, sometimes leading
  to scrollbars appearing during the movement.
- Nav: Fixed rare crash when e.g. releasing Alt-key while focusing a window with a menu at the same
  frame as clearing the focus. This was in most noticeable in back-ends such as Glfw and SDL which
  emits key release events when focusing another viewport, leading to Alt+clicking on void on another
  viewport triggering the issue. (#2609)
- TreeNode, CollapsingHeader: Fixed highlight frame not covering horizontal area fully when using
  horizontal scrolling. (#2211, #2579)
- TabBar: Fixed BeginTabBar() within a window with horizontal scrolling from creating a feedback
  loop with the horizontal contents size.
- Columns: Fixed Columns() within a window with horizontal scrolling from not covering the full
  horizontal area (previously only worked with an explicit contents size). (#125)
- Columns: Fixed Separator from creating an extraneous draw command. (#125)
- Columns: Fixed Selectable with SpanAllColumns flag from creating an extraneous draw command. (#125)
- Style: Added style.WindowMenuButtonPosition (left/right, defaults to ImGuiDir_Left) to move the
  collapsing/docking button to the other side of the title bar.
- Style: Made window close button cross slightly smaller.
- Log/Capture: Fixed BeginTabItem() label not being included in a text log/capture.
- ImDrawList: Added ImDrawCmd::VtxOffset value to support large meshes (64k+ vertices) using 16-bits indices.
  The renderer back-end needs to set 'io.BackendFlags |= ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset' to enable
  this, and honor the ImDrawCmd::VtxOffset field. Otherwise the value will always be zero.
  This has the advantage of preserving smaller index buffers and allowing to execute on hardware that do not
  support 32-bits indices. Most examples back-ends have been modified to support the VtxOffset field.
- ImDrawList: Added ImDrawCmd::IdxOffset value, equivalent to summing element count for each draw command.
  This is provided for convenience and consistency with VtxOffset.
- ImDrawCallback: Allow to override the signature of ImDrawCallback by #define-ing it. This is meant to
  facilitate custom rendering back-ends passing local render-specific data to the draw callback.
- ImFontAtlas: FreeType: Added RasterizerFlags::Monochrome flag to disable font anti-aliasing. Combine
  with RasterizerFlags::MonoHinting for best results. (#2545) [@HolyBlackCat]
- ImFontGlyphRangesBuilder: Fixed unnecessarily over-sized buffer, which incidentally was also not
  fully cleared. Fixed edge-case overflow when adding character 0xFFFF. (#2568). [@NIKE3500]
- Demo: Added full "Dear ImGui" prefix to the title of "Dear ImGui Demo" and "Dear ImGui Metrics" windows.
- Backends: Add native Mac clipboard copy/paste default implementation in core library to match what we are
  dealing with Win32, and to facilitate integration in custom engines. (#2546) [@andrewwillmott]
- Backends: OSX: imgui_impl_osx: Added mouse cursor support. (#2585, #1873) [@actboy168]
- Examples/Backends: DirectX9/10/11/12, Metal, Vulkan, OpenGL3 (Desktop GL only): Added support for large meshes
  (64k+ vertices) with 16-bits indices, enable 'ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset' in those back-ends.
- Examples/Backends: Don't filter characters under 0x10000 before calling io.AddInputCharacter(),
  the filtering is done in io.AddInputCharacter() itself. This is in prevision for fuller Unicode
  support. (#2538, #2541)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.70 (Released 2019-05-06)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:
- ImDrawList: Improved algorithm for mitre joints on thick lines, preserving correct thickness
  up to 90 degrees angles (e.g. rectangles). If you have custom rendering using thick lines,
  they will appear a little thicker now. (#2518) [@rmitton]
- Obsoleted GetContentRegionAvailWidth(), use GetContentRegionAvail().x instead.
  Kept inline redirection function.
- Examples: Vulkan: Added MinImageCount/ImageCount fields in ImGui_ImplVulkan_InitInfo, required
  during initialization to specify the number of in-flight image requested by swap chains.
  (was previously a hard #define IMGUI_VK_QUEUED_FRAMES 2). (#2071, #1677) [@nathanvoglsam]
- Examples: Vulkan: Tidying up the demo/internals helpers (most engine/app should not rely
  on them but it is possible you have!).

Other Changes:
- ImDrawList: Added ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState, a special ImDrawList::AddCallback() value
  to request the renderer back-end to reset its render state. (#2037, #1639, #2452)
  Examples: Added support for ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState in all renderer back-ends. Each
  renderer code setting up initial render state has been moved to a function so it could be
  called at the start of rendering and when a ResetRenderState is requested. [@ocornut, @bear24rw]
- InputText: Fixed selection background rendering one frame after the cursor movement when
  first transitioning from no-selection to has-selection. (Bug in 1.69) (#2436) [@Nazg-Gul]
- InputText: Work-around for buggy standard libraries where isprint('\t') returns true. (#2467, #1336)
- InputText: Fixed ImGuiInputTextFlags_AllowTabInput leading to two tabs characters being inserted
  if the back-end provided both Key and Character input. (#2467, #1336)
- Layout: Added SetNextItemWidth() helper to avoid using PushItemWidth/PopItemWidth() for single items.
  Note that SetNextItemWidth() currently only affect the same subset of items as PushItemWidth(),
  generally referred to as the large framed+labeled items. Because the new SetNextItemWidth()
  function is explicit we may later extend its effect to more items.
- Layout: Fixed PushItemWidth(-width) for right-side alignment laying out some items (button, listbox, etc.)
  with negative sizes if the 'width' argument was smaller than the available width at the time of item
  submission.
- Window: Fixed window with the AlwaysAutoResize flag unnecessarily extending their hovering boundaries
  by a few pixels (this is used to facilitate resizing from borders when available for a given window).
  One of the noticeable minor side effect was that navigating menus would have had a tendency to disable
  highlight from parent menu items earlier than necessary while approaching the child menu.
- Window: Close button is horizontally aligned with style.FramePadding.x.
- Window: Fixed contents region being off by WindowBorderSize amount on the right when scrollbar is active.
- Window: Fixed SetNextWindowSizeConstraints() with non-rounded positions making windows drift. (#2067, #2530)
- Popups: Closing a popup restores the focused/nav window in place at the time of the popup opening,
  instead of restoring the window that was in the window stack at the time of the OpenPopup call. (#2517)
  Among other things, this allows opening a popup while no window are focused, and pressing Escape to
  clear the focus again.
- Popups: Fixed right-click from closing all popups instead of aiming at the hovered popup level
  (regression in 1.67).
- Selectable: With ImGuiSelectableFlags_AllowDoubleClick doesn't return true on the mouse button release
  following the double-click. Only first mouse release + second mouse down (double-click) returns true.
  Likewise for internal ButtonBehavior() with both _PressedOnClickRelease | _PressedOnDoubleClick. (#2503)
- GetMouseDragDelta(): also returns the delta on the mouse button released frame. (#2419)
- GetMouseDragDelta(): verify that mouse positions are valid otherwise returns zero.
- Inputs: Also add support for horizontal scroll with Shift+Mouse Wheel. (#2424, #1463) [@LucaRood]
- PlotLines, PlotHistogram: Ignore NaN values when calculating min/max bounds. (#2485)
- Columns: Fixed boundary of clipping being off by 1 pixel within the left column. (#125)
- Separator: Declare its thickness (1.0f) to the layout, making items around separator more symmetrical.
- Combo, Slider, Scrollbar: Improve rendering in situation when there's only a few pixels available (<3 pixels).
- Nav: Fixed Drag/Slider functions going into text input mode when keyboard CTRL is held while pressing NavActivate.
- Drag and Drop: Fixed drag source with ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceAllowNullID and null ID from receiving click
  regardless of being covered by another window (it didn't honor correct hovering rules). (#2521)
- ImDrawList: Improved algorithm for mitre joints on thick lines, preserving correct thickness up to 90 degrees
  angles, also faster to output. (#2518) [@rmitton]
- Misc: Added IM_MALLOC/IM_FREE macros mimicking IM_NEW/IM_DELETE so user doesn't need to revert
  to using the ImGui::MemAlloc()/MemFree() calls directly.
- Misc: Made IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() macro also check for matching size of ImDrawIdx.
- Metrics: Added "Show windows rectangles" tool to visualize the different rectangles.
- Demo: Improved trees in columns demo.
- Examples: OpenGL: Added a dummy GL call + comments in ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_Init() to detect uninitialized
  GL function loaders early, and help users understand what they are missing. (#2421)
- Examples: SDL: Added support for SDL_GameController gamepads (enable with ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad). (#2509) [@DJLink]
- Examples: Emscripten: Added Emscripten+SDL+GLES2 example. (#2494, #2492, #2351, #336) [@nicolasnoble, @redblobgames]
- Examples: Metal: Added Glfw+Metal example. (#2527) [@bear24rw]
- Examples: OpenGL3: Minor tweaks + not calling glBindBuffer more than necessary in the render loop.
- Examples: Vulkan: Fixed in-flight buffers issues when using multi-viewports. (#2461, #2348, #2378, #2097)
- Examples: Vulkan: Added missing support for 32-bit indices (#define ImDrawIdx unsigned int).
- Examples: Vulkan: Avoid passing negative coordinates to vkCmdSetScissor, which debug validation layers do not like.
- Examples: Vulkan: Added ImGui_ImplVulkan_SetMinImageCount() to change min image count at runtime. (#2071) [@nathanvoglsam]
- Examples: DirectX9: Fixed erroneous assert in ImGui_ImplDX9_InvalidateDeviceObjects(). (#2454)
- Examples: DirectX10/11/12, Allegro, Marmalade: Render functions early out when display size is zero (minimized). (#2496)
- Examples: GLUT: Fixed existing FreeGLUT example to work with regular GLUT. (#2465) [@andrewwillmott]
- Examples: GLUT: Renamed imgui_impl_freeglut.cpp/.h to imgui_impl_glut.cpp/.h. (#2465) [@andrewwillmott]
- Examples: GLUT: Made io.DeltaTime always > 0. (#2430)
- Examples: Visual Studio: Updated default platform toolset+sdk in vcproj files from v100+sdk7 (vs2010)
  to v110+sdk8 (vs2012). This is mostly so we can remove reliance on DXSDK_DIR for the DX10/DX11 example,
  which if existing and when switching to recent SDK ends up conflicting and creating warnings.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.69 (Released 2019-03-13)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- Renamed ColorEdit/ColorPicker's ImGuiColorEditFlags_RGB/_HSV/_HEX flags to respectively
  ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayRGB/_DisplayHSV/_DisplayHex. This is because the addition of
  new flag ImGuiColorEditFlags_InputHSV makes the earlier one ambiguous.
  Kept redirection enum values (will obsolete). (#2384) [@haldean]
- Renamed GetOverlayDrawList() to GetForegroundDrawList(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete). (#2391)

Other Changes:

- Added GetBackgroundDrawList() helper to quickly get access to a ImDrawList that will be rendered
  behind every other windows. (#2391, #545)
- DragScalar, InputScalar, SliderScalar: Added support for u8/s8/u16/s16 data types (ImGuiDataType_S8, etc.)
  We are reusing function instances of larger types to reduce code size. (#643, #320, #708, #1011)
- Added InputTextWithHint() to display a description/hint in the text box when no text
  has been entered. (#2400) [@Organic-Code, @ocornut]
- Nav: Fixed a tap on AltGR (e.g. German keyboard) from navigating to the menu layer.
- Nav: Fixed Ctrl+Tab keeping active InputText() of a previous window active after the switch. (#2380)
- Fixed IsItemDeactivated()/IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() from not correctly returning true
  when tabbing out of a focusable widget (Input/Slider/Drag) in most situations. (#2215, #1875)
- InputInt, InputFloat, InputScalar: Fix to keep the label of the +/- buttons centered when
  style.FramePadding.x is abnormally larger than style.FramePadding.y. Since the buttons are
  meant to be square (to align with e.g. color button) we always use FramePadding.y. (#2367)
- InputInt, InputScalar: +/- buttons now respects the natural type limits instead of
  overflowing or underflowing the value.
- InputText: Fixed an edge case crash that would happen if another widget sharing the same ID
  is being swapped with an InputText that has yet to be activated.
- InputText: Fixed various display corruption related to swapping the underlying buffer while
  a input widget is active (both for writable and read-only paths). Often they would manifest
  when manipulating the scrollbar of a multi-line input text.
- ColorEdit, ColorPicker, ColorButton: Added ImGuiColorEditFlags_InputHSV to manipulate color
  values encoded as HSV (in order to avoid HSV<>RGB round trips and associated singularities).
  (#2383, #2384) [@haldean]
- ColorPicker: Fixed a bug/assertion when displaying a color picker in a collapsed window
  while dragging its title bar. (#2389)
- ColorEdit: Fixed tooltip not honoring the ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoAlpha contract of never
  reading the 4th float in the array (value was read and discarded). (#2384) [@haldean]
- MenuItem, Selectable: Fixed disabled widget interfering with navigation (fix c2db7f63 in 1.67).
- TabBar: Fixed a crash when using many BeginTabBar() recursively (didn't affect docking). (#2371)
- TabBar: Added extra mis-usage error recovery. Past the assert, common mis-usage don't lead to
  hard crashes any more, facilitating integration with scripting languages. (#1651)
- TabBar: Fixed ImGuiTabItemFlags_SetSelected being ignored if the tab is not visible (with
  scrolling policy enabled) or if is currently appearing.
- TabBar: Fixed Tab tooltip code making drag and drop tooltip disappear during the frame where
  the drag payload activate a tab.
- TabBar: Reworked scrolling policy (when ImGuiTabBarFlags_FittingPolicyScroll is set) to
  teleport the view when aiming at a tab far away the visible section, and otherwise accelerate
  the scrolling speed to cap the scrolling time to 0.3 seconds.
- Text: Fixed large Text/TextUnformatted calls not feeding their size into layout when starting
  below the lower point of the current clipping rectangle. This bug has been there since v1.0!
  It was hardly noticeable but would affect the scrolling range, which in turn would affect
  some scrolling request functions when called during the appearing frame of a window.
- Plot: Fixed divide-by-zero in PlotLines() when passing a count of 1. (#2387) [@Lectem]
- Log/Capture: Fixed LogXXX functions emitting extraneous leading carriage return.
- Log/Capture: Fixed an issue when empty string on a new line would not emit a carriage return.
- Log/Capture: Fixed LogXXX functions 'auto_open_depth' parameter being treated as an absolute
  tree depth instead of a relative one.
- Log/Capture: Fixed CollapsingHeader trailing ascii representation being "#" instead of "##".
- ImFont: Added GetGlyphRangesVietnamese() helper. (#2403)
- Misc: Asserting in NewFrame() if style.WindowMinSize is zero or smaller than (1.0f,1.0f).
- Demo: Using GetBackgroundDrawList() and GetForegroundDrawList() in "Custom Rendering" demo.
- Demo: InputText: Demonstrating use of ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackResize. (#2006, #1443, #1008).
- Examples: GLFW, SDL: Preserve DisplayFramebufferScale when main viewport is minimized.
  (This is particularly useful for the viewport branch because we are not supporting per-viewport
  frame-buffer scale. It fixes windows not refreshing when main viewport is minimized.) (#2416)
- Examples: OpenGL: Fix to be able to run on ES 2.0 / WebGL 1.0. [@rmitton, @gabrielcuvillier]
- Examples: OpenGL: Fix for OSX not supporting OpenGL 4.5, we don't try to read GL_CLIP_ORIGIN
  even if the OpenGL headers/loader happens to define the value. (#2366, #2186)
- Examples: Allegro: Added support for touch events (emulating mouse). (#2219) [@dos1]
- Examples: DirectX9: Minor changes to match the other DirectX examples more closely. (#2394)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.68 (Released 2019-02-19)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- Removed io.DisplayVisibleMin/DisplayVisibleMax (which were marked obsolete and removed from viewport/docking branch already).
- Made it illegal/assert when io.DisplayTime == 0.0f (with an exception for the first frame).
  If for some reason your time step calculation gives you a zero value, replace it with a dummy small value!

Other Changes:

- Added .editorconfig file for text editors to standardize using spaces. (#2038) [@kudaba]
- ImDrawData: Added FramebufferScale field (currently a copy of the value from io.DisplayFramebufferScale).
  This is to allow render functions being written without pulling any data from ImGuiIO, allowing incoming
  multi-viewport feature to behave on Retina display and with multiple displays.
  If you are not using a custom binding, please update your render function code ahead of time,
  and use draw_data->FramebufferScale instead of io.DisplayFramebufferScale. (#2306, #1676)
- Added IsItemActivated() as an extension to the IsItemDeactivated/IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit functions
  which are useful to implement variety of undo patterns. (#820, #956, #1875)
- InputText: Fixed a bug where ESCAPE would not restore the initial value in all situations. (#2321) [@relick]
- InputText: Fixed a bug where ESCAPE would be first captured by the Keyboard Navigation code. (#2321, #787)
- InputText: Fixed redo buffer exhaustion handling (rare) which could corrupt the undo character buffer. (#2333)
  The way the redo/undo buffers work would have made it generally unnoticeable to the user.
- Fixed range-version of PushID() and GetID() not honoring the ### operator to restart from the seed value.
- Fixed CloseCurrentPopup() on a child-menu of a modal incorrectly closing the modal. (#2308)
- Tabs: Added ImGuiTabBarFlags_TabListPopupButton flag to show a popup button on manual tab bars. (#261, #351)
- Tabs: Removed ImGuiTabBarFlags_NoTabListPopupButton which was available in 1.67 but actually had zero use.
- Tabs: Fixed a minor clipping glitch when changing style's FramePadding from frame to frame.
- Tabs: Fixed border (when enabled) so it is aligned correctly mid-pixel and appears as bright as other borders.
- Style, Selectable: Added ImGuiStyle::SelectableTextAlign and ImGuiStyleVar_SelectableTextAlign. (#2347) [@haldean]
- Menus: Tweaked horizontal overlap between parent and child menu (to help convey relative depth)
  from using style.ItemSpacing.x to style.ItemInnerSpacing.x, the later being expected to be smaller. (#1086)
- RadioButton: Fixed label horizontal alignment to precisely match Checkbox().
- Window: When resizing from an edge, the border is more visible and better follow the rounded corners.
- Window: Fixed initial width of collapsed windows not taking account of contents width (broken in 1.67). (#2336, #176)
- Scrollbar: Fade out and disable interaction when too small, in order to facilitate using the resize grab on very
  small window, as well as reducing visual noise/overlap.
- ListBox: Better optimized when clipped / non-visible.
- InputTextMultiline: Better optimized when clipped / non-visible.
- Font: Fixed high-level ImGui::CalcTextSize() used by most widgets from erroneously subtracting 1.0f*scale to
  calculated text width. Among noticeable side-effects, it would make sequences of repeated Text/SameLine calls
  not align the same as a single call, and create mismatch between high-level size calculation and those performed
  with the lower-level ImDrawList api. (#792) [@SlNPacifist]
- Font: Fixed building atlas when specifying duplicate/overlapping ranges within a same font. (#2353, #2233)
- ImDrawList: Fixed AddCircle(), AddCircleFilled() angle step being off, which was visible when drawing a "circle"
  with a small number of segments (e.g. an hexagon). (#2287) [@baktery]
- ImGuiTextBuffer: Added append() function (unformatted).
- ImFontAtlas: Added 0x2000-0x206F general punctuation range to default ChineseFull/ChineseSimplifiedCommon ranges. (#2093)
- ImFontAtlas: FreeType: Added support for imgui allocators + custom FreeType only SetAllocatorFunctions. (#2285) [@Vuhdo]
- ImFontAtlas: FreeType: Fixed using imgui_freetype.cpp in unity builds. (#2302)
- Demo: Fixed "Log" demo not initializing properly, leading to the first line not showing before a Clear. (#2318) [@bluescan]
- Demo: Added "Auto-scroll" option in Log/Console demos. (#2300) [@nicolasnoble, @ocornut]
- Examples: Metal, OpenGL2, OpenGL3, Vulkan: Fixed offsetting of clipping rectangle with ImDrawData::DisplayPos != (0,0)
  when the display frame-buffer scale scale is not (1,1). While this doesn't make a difference when using master branch,
  this is effectively fixing support for multi-viewport with Mac Retina Displays on those examples. (#2306) [@rasky, @ocornut]
  Also using ImDrawData::FramebufferScale instead of io.DisplayFramebufferScale.
- Examples: Clarified the use the ImDrawData::DisplayPos to offset clipping rectangles.
- Examples: Win32: Using GetForegroundWindow()+IsChild() instead of GetActiveWindow() to be compatible with windows created
  in a different thread or parent. (#1951, #2087, #2156, #2232) [many people]
- Examples: SDL: Using the SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI flag. (#2306, #1676) [@rasky]
- Examples: Win32: Added support for XInput gamepads (if ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad is enabled).
- Examples: Win32: Added support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 via WM_XBUTTON* messages. (#2264)
- Examples: DirectX9: Explicitly disable fog (D3DRS_FOGENABLE) before drawing in case user state has it set. (#2288, #2230)
- Examples: OpenGL2: Added #define GL_SILENCE_DEPRECATION to cope with newer XCode warnings.
- Examples: OpenGL3: Using GLSL 4.10 shaders for any GLSL version over 410 (e.g. 430, 450). (#2329) [@BrutPitt]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.67 (Released 2019-01-14)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- Made it illegal to call Begin("") with an empty string. This somehow half-worked before but had various undesirable
  side-effect because the window would have ID zero. In particular it is causing problems in viewport/docking branches.
- Renamed io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges to io.ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges and removed its [Beta] mark.
  The addition of new configuration options in the Docking branch is pushing for a little reorganization of those names.
- Renamed ImFontAtlas::GlyphRangesBuilder to ImFontGlyphRangesBuilder. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).

Other Changes:
- Added BETA api for Tab Bar/Tabs widgets: (#261, #351)
  - Added BeginTabBar(), EndTabBar(), BeginTabItem(), EndTabItem(), SetTabItemClosed() API.
  - Added ImGuiTabBarFlags flags for BeginTabBar().
  - Added ImGuiTabItemFlags flags for BeginTabItem().
  - Style: Added ImGuiCol_Tab, ImGuiCol_TabHovered, ImGuiCol_TabActive, ImGuiCol_TabUnfocused, ImGuiCol_TabUnfocusedActive colors.
  - Demo: Added Layout->Tabs demo code.
  - Demo: Added "Documents" example app showcasing possible use for tabs.
  This feature was merged from the Docking branch in order to allow the use of regular tabs in your code.
  (It does not provide the docking/splitting/merging of windows available in the Docking branch)
- Added ImGuiWindowFlags_UnsavedDocument window flag to append '*' to title without altering the ID, as a convenience
  to avoid using the ### operator. In the Docking branch this also has an effect on tab closing behavior.
- Window, Focus, Popup: Fixed an issue where closing a popup by clicking another window with the _NoMove flag would refocus
  the parent window of the popup instead of the newly clicked window.
- Window: Contents size is preserved while a window collapsed. Fix auto-resizing window losing their size for one frame when uncollapsed.
- Window: Contents size is preserved while a window contents is hidden (unless it is hidden for resizing purpose).
- Window: Resizing windows from edge is now enabled by default (io.ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges=true). Note that
  it only works _if_ the back-end sets ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors, which the standard back-ends do.
- Window: Added io.ConfigWindowsMoveFromTitleBarOnly option. This is ignored by window with no title bars (often popups).
  This affects clamping window within the visible area: with this option enabled title bars need to be visible. (#899)
- Window: Fixed using SetNextWindowPos() on a child window (which wasn't really documented) position the cursor as expected
  in the parent window, so there is no mismatch between the layout in parent and the position of the child window.
- InputFloat: When using ImGuiInputTextFlags_ReadOnly the step buttons are disabled. (#2257)
- DragFloat: Fixed broken mouse direction change with power!=1.0. (#2174, #2206) [@Joshhua5]
- Nav: Fixed an keyboard issue where holding Activate/Space for longer than two frames on a button would unnecessary
  keep the focus on the parent window, which could steal it from newly appearing windows. (#787)
- Nav: Fixed animated window titles from being updated when displayed in the CTRL+Tab list. (#787)
- Error recovery: Extraneous/undesired calls to End() are now being caught by an assert in the End() function closer
  to the user call site (instead of being reported in EndFrame). Past the assert, they don't lead to crashes any more. (#1651)
  Missing calls to End(), past the assert, should not lead to crashes or to the fallback Debug window appearing on screen.
  Those changes makes it easier to integrate dear imgui with a scripting language allowing, given asserts are redirected
  into e.g. an error log and stopping the script execution.
- ImFontAtlas: Stb and FreeType: Atlas width is now properly based on total surface rather than glyph count (unless overridden with TexDesiredWidth).
- ImFontAtlas: Stb and FreeType: Fixed atlas builder so missing glyphs won't influence the atlas texture width. (#2233)
- ImFontAtlas: Stb and FreeType: Fixed atlas builder so duplicate glyphs (when merging fonts) won't be included in the rasterized atlas.
- ImFontAtlas: FreeType: Fixed abnormally high atlas height.
- ImFontAtlas: FreeType: Fixed support for any values of TexGlyphPadding (not just only 1).
- ImDrawList: Optimized some of the functions for performance of debug builds where non-inline function call cost are non-negligible.
  (Our test UI scene on VS2015 Debug Win64 with /RTC1 went ~5.9 ms -> ~4.9 ms. In Release same scene stays at ~0.3 ms.)
- IO: Added BackendPlatformUserData, BackendRendererUserData, BackendLanguageUserData void* for storage use by back-ends.
- IO: Renamed InputCharacters[], marked internal as was always intended. Please don't access directly, and use AddInputCharacter() instead!
- IO: AddInputCharacter() goes into a queue which can receive as many characters as needed during the frame. This is useful
  for automation to not have an upper limit on typing speed. Will later transition key/mouse to use the event queue later.
- Style: Tweaked default value of style.DisplayWindowPadding from (20,20) to (19,19) so the default style as a value
  which is the same as the title bar height.
- Demo: "Simple Layout" and "Style Editor" are now using tabs.
- Demo: Added a few more things under "Child windows" (changing ImGuiCol_ChildBg, positioning child, using IsItemHovered after a child).
- Examples: DirectX10/11/12: Made imgui_impl_dx10/dx11/dx12.cpp link d3dcompiler.lib from the .cpp file to ease integration.
- Examples: Allegro 5: Properly destroy globals on shutdown to allow for restart. (#2262) [@DomRe]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.66b (Released 2018-12-01)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Changes:

- Fixed a text rendering/clipping bug introduced in 1.66 (on 2018-10-12, commit ede3a3b9) that affect single ImDrawList::AddText()
  calls with single strings larger than 10k. Text/TextUnformatted() calls were not affected, but e.g. InputText() was. [@pdoane]
- When the focused window become inactive don't restore focus to a window with the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs flag. (#2213) [@zzzyap]
- Separator: Fixed Separator() outputting an extraneous empty line when captured into clipboard/text/file.
- Demo: Added ShowAboutWindow() call, previously was only accessible from the demo window.
- Demo: ShowAboutWindow() now display various Build/Config Information (compiler, os, etc.) that can easily be copied into bug reports.
- Fixed build issue with osxcross and macOS. (#2218) [@dos1]
- Examples: Setting up 'io.BackendPlatformName'/'io.BackendRendererName' fields to the current back-end can be displayed in the About window.
- Examples: SDL: changed the signature of ImGui_ImplSDL2_ProcessEvent() to use a const SDL_Event*. (#2187)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.66 (Released 2018-11-22)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- Renamed SetScrollHere() to SetScrollHereY(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed misc/stl/imgui_stl.* to misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.* in prevision for other C++ helper files. (#2035, #2096)

Other Changes:

- Fixed calling SetNextWindowSize()/SetWindowSize() with non-integer values leading to
  accidental alteration of window position. We now round the provided size. (#2067)
- Fixed calling DestroyContext() always saving .ini data with the current context instead
  of the supplied context pointer. (#2066)
- Nav, Focus: Fixed ImGuiWindowFlags_NoBringToFrontOnFocus windows not being restoring focus
  properly after the main menu bar or last focused window is deactivated.
- Nav: Fixed an assert in certain circumstance (mostly when using popups) when mouse positions stop being valid. (#2168)
- Nav: Fixed explicit directional input not re-highlighting current nav item if there is a single item in the window
  and highlight has been previously disabled by the mouse. (#787)
- DragFloat: Fixed a situation where dragging with value rounding enabled or with a power curve
  erroneously wrapped the value to one of the min/max edge. (#2024, #708, #320, #2075).
- DragFloat: Disabled using power curve when one edge is FLT_MAX (broken in 1.61). (#2024)
- DragFloat: Disabled setting a default drag speed when one edge is FLT_MAX. (#2024)
- SliderAngle: Added optional format argument to alter precision or localize the string. (#2150) [@podsvirov]
- Window: Resizing from edges (with io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges Beta flag) extends the hit region
  of root floating windows outside the window, making it easier to resize windows. Resize grips are also
  extended accordingly so there are no discontinuity when hovering between borders and corners. (#1495, #822)
- Window: Added ImGuiWindowFlags_NoBackground flag to avoid rendering window background. This is mostly to allow
  the creation of new flag combinations, as we could already use SetNextWindowBgAlpha(0.0f). (#1660) [@biojppm, @ocornut]
- Window: Added ImGuiWindowFlags_NoDecoration helper flag which is essentially NoTitleBar+NoResize+NoScrollbar+NoCollapse.
- Window: Added ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMouseInputs which is basically the old ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs (essentially
  we have renamed ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs to ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMouseInputs). Made the new ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs
  encompass both NoMouseInputs+NoNav, which is consistent with its description. (#1660, #787)
- Window, Inputs: Fixed resizing from edges when io.MousePos is not pixel-rounded by rounding mouse position input. (#2110)
- BeginChild(): Fixed BeginChild(const char*, ...) variation erroneously not applying the ID stack
  to the provided string to uniquely identify the child window. This was undoing an intentional change
  introduced in 1.50 and broken in 1.60. (#1698, #894, #713).
- TextUnformatted(): Fixed a case where large-text path would read bytes past the text_end marker depending
  on the position of new lines in the buffer (it wasn't affecting the output but still not the right thing to do!)
- ListBox(): Fixed frame sizing when items_count==1 unnecessarily showing a scrollbar. (#2173) [@luk1337, @ocornut]
- ListBox(): Tweaked frame sizing so list boxes will look more consistent when FramePadding is far from ItemSpacing.
- RenderText(): Some optimization for very large text buffers, useful for non-optimized builds.
- BeginMenu(): Fixed menu popup horizontal offset being off the item in the menu bar when WindowPadding=0.0f.
- ArrowButton(): Fixed arrow shape being horizontally misaligned by (FramePadding.y-FramePadding.x) if they are different.
- Demo: Split the contents of ShowDemoWindow() into smaller functions as it appears to speed up link time with VS. (#2152)
- Drag and Drop: Added GetDragDropPayload() to peek directly into the payload (if any) from anywhere. (#143)
- ImGuiTextBuffer: Avoid heap allocation when empty.
- ImDrawList: Fixed AddConvexPolyFilled() undefined behavior when passing points_count smaller than 3,
  in particular, points_count==0 could lead to a memory stomp if the draw list was previously empty.
- Examples: DirectX10, DirectX11: Removed seemingly unnecessary calls to invalidate and recreate device objects
  in the WM_SIZE handler. (#2088) [@ice1000]
- Examples: GLFW: User previously installed GLFW callbacks are now saved and chain-called by the default callbacks. (#1759)
- Examples: OpenGL3: Added support for GL 4.5's glClipControl(GL_UPPER_LEFT). (#2186)
- Examples: OpenGL3+GLFW: Fixed error condition when using the GLAD loader. (#2157) [@blackball]
- Examples: OpenGL3+GLFW/SDL: Made main.cpp compile with IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_LOADER_CUSTOM (may be missing init). (#2178) [@doug-moen]
- Examples: SDL2+Vulkan: Fixed application shutdown which could deadlock on Linux + Xorg. (#2181) [@eRabbit0]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.65 (Released 2018-09-06)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- Renamed stb_truetype.h to imstb_truetype.h, stb_textedit.h to imstb_textedit.h, and
  stb_rect_pack.h to imstb_rectpack.h. If you were conveniently using the imgui copy of those
  STB headers in your project, you will have to update your include paths. (#1718, #2036)
  The reason for this change is to avoid conflicts for projects that may also be importing
  their own copy of the STB libraries. Note that imgui's copy of stb_textedit.h is modified.
- Renamed io.ConfigCursorBlink to io.ConfigInputTextCursorBlink. (#1427)

Other Changes:

- This is a minor release following the 1.64 refactor, with a little more shuffling of code.
- Clarified and improved the source code sectioning in all files (easier to search or browse sections).
- Nav: Removed the [Beta] tag from various descriptions of the gamepad/keyboard navigation system.
  Although it is not perfect and will keep being improved, it is fairly functional and used by many. (#787)
- Fixed a build issue with non-Cygwin GCC under Windows.
- Demo: Added a "Configuration" block to make io.ConfigFlags/io.BackendFlags more prominent.
- Examples: OpenGL3+SDL2: Fixed error condition when using the GLAD loader. (#2059, #2002) [@jiri]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.64 (Released 2018-08-31)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

- Moved README, CHANGELOG and TODO files to the docs/ folder.
  If you are updating dear imgui by copying files, take the chance to delete the old files.
- Added imgui_widgets.cpp file, extracted and moved widgets code out of imgui.cpp into imgui_widgets.cpp.
  Re-ordered some of the code remaining in imgui.cpp.
  NONE OF THE FUNCTIONS HAVE CHANGED. THE CODE IS SEMANTICALLY 100% IDENTICAL, BUT _EVERY_ FUNCTIONS HAS BEEN MOVED.
  Because of this, any local modifications to imgui.cpp will likely conflict when you update.
  If you have any modifications to imgui.cpp, it is suggested that you first update to 1.63, then
  isolate your patches. You can peak at imgui_widgets.cpp from 1.64 to get a sense of what is included in it,
  then separate your changes into several patches that can more easily be applied to 1.64 on a per-file basis.
  What I found worked nicely for me, was to open the diff of the old patches in an interactive merge/diff tool,
  search for the corresponding function in the new code and apply the chunks manually.
- As a reminder, if you have any change to imgui.cpp it is a good habit to discuss them on the github,
  so a solution applicable on the Master branch can be found. If your company has changes that you cannot
  disclose you may also contact me privately.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.63 (Released 2018-08-29)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- Style: Renamed ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDarkening to ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDimBg for consistency with other features.
  Kept redirection enum (will obsolete).
- Changed ImGui::GetTime() return value from float to double to avoid accumulating floating point imprecision over time.
- Removed per-window ImGuiWindowFlags_ResizeFromAnySide Beta flag in favor `io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges=true` to
  enable the feature globally. (#1495)
  The feature is not currently enabled by default because it is not satisfying enough, but will eventually be.
- InputText: Renamed ImGuiTextEditCallback to ImGuiInputTextCallback, ImGuiTextEditCallbackData to ImGuiInputTextCallbackData
  for consistency. Kept redirection types (will obsolete).
- InputText: Removed ImGuiTextEditCallbackData::ReadOnly because it is a duplication of (::Flags & ImGuiInputTextFlags_ReadOnly).
- Renamed IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() to IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() for consistency with new IsItemEdited() API.
  Kept redirection function (will obsolete soonish as IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() is very recent).
- Renamed io.OptCursorBlink to io.ConfigCursorBlink [-> io.ConfigInputTextCursorBlink in 1.65], io.OptMacOSXBehaviors to
  io.ConfigMacOSXBehaviors for consistency. (#1427, #473)
- Removed obsolete redirection functions: CollapsingHeader() variation with 2 bools - marked obsolete in v1.49, May 2016.

Other Changes:

- ArrowButton: Fixed to honor PushButtonRepeat() setting (and internals' ImGuiItemFlags_ButtonRepeat).
- ArrowButton: Setup current line text baseline so that ArrowButton() + SameLine() + Text() are aligned properly.
- Nav: Added a CTRL+TAB window list and changed the highlight system accordingly. The change is motivated by upcoming
  Docking features. (#787)
- Nav: Made CTRL+TAB skip menus + skip the current navigation window if is has the ImGuiWindow_NoNavFocus set. (#787)
  While it was previously possible, you won't be able to CTRL-TAB out and immediately back in a window with the
  ImGuiWindow_NoNavFocus flag.
- Window: Allow menu and popups windows from ignoring the style.WindowMinSize values so short menus/popups are not padded. (#1909)
- Window: Added global io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges option to enable resizing windows from their edges and from
  the lower-left corner. (#1495)
- Window: Collapse button shows hovering highlight + clicking and dragging on it allows to drag the window as well.
- Added IsItemEdited() to query if the last item modified its value (or was pressed). This is equivalent to the bool
  returned by most widgets.
  It is useful in some situation e.g. using InputText() with ImGuiInputTextFlags_EnterReturnsTrue. (#2034)
- InputText: Added support for buffer size/capacity changes via the ImGuiInputTextFlags_CallbackResize flag. (#2006, #1443, #1008).
- InputText: Fixed not tracking the cursor horizontally when modifying the text buffer through a callback.
- InputText: Fixed minor off-by-one issue when submitting a buffer size smaller than the initial zero-terminated buffer contents.
- InputText: Fixed a few pathological crash cases on single-line InputText widget with multiple millions characters worth of contents.
  Because the current text drawing function reserve for a worst-case amount of vertices and how we handle horizontal clipping,
  we currently just avoid displaying those single-line widgets when they are over a threshold of 2 millions characters,
  until a better solution is found.
- Drag and Drop: Fixed an incorrect assert when dropping a source that is submitted after the target (bug introduced with 1.62 changes
  related to the addition of IsItemDeactivated()). (#1875, #143)
- Drag and Drop: Fixed ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceNoDisableHover to affect hovering state prior to calling IsItemHovered() + fixed description. (#143)
- Drag and Drop: Calling BeginTooltip() between a BeginDragSource()/EndDragSource() or BeginDropTarget()/EndDropTarget() uses adjusted tooltip
  settings matching the one created when calling BeginDragSource() without the ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceNoPreviewTooltip flag. (#143)
- Drag and Drop: Payload stays available and under the mouse if the source stops being submitted, however the tooltip is replaced by "...". (#1725)
- Drag and Drop: Added ImGuiDragDropFlags_SourceAutoExpirePayload flag to force payload to expire if the source stops being submitted. (#1725, #143).
- IsItemHovered(): Added ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenDisabled flag to query hovered status on disabled items. (#1940, #211)
- Selectable: Added ImGuiSelectableFlags_Disabled flag in the public API. (#211)
- ColorEdit4: Fixed a bug when text input or drag and drop leading to unsaturated HSV values would erroneously alter the resulting color. (#2050)
- Misc: Added optional misc/stl/imgui_stl.h wrapper to use with STL types (e.g. InputText with std::string). (#2006, #1443, #1008)
  [*EDIT* renamed to misc/std/imgui_stdlib.h in 1.66]
- Misc: Added IMGUI_VERSION_NUM for easy compile-time testing. (#2025)
- Misc: Added ImGuiMouseCursor_Hand cursor enum + corresponding software cursor. (#1913, 1914) [@aiekick, @ocornut]
- Misc: Tweaked software mouse cursor offset to match the offset of the corresponding Windows 10 cursors.
- Made assertion more clear when trying to call Begin() outside of the NewFrame()..EndFrame() scope. (#1987)
- Fixed assertion when transitioning from an active ID to another within a group, affecting ColorPicker (broken in 1.62). (#2023, #820, #956, #1875).
- Fixed PushID() from keeping alive the new ID Stack top value (if a previously active widget shared the ID it would be erroneously kept alive).
- Fixed horizontal mouse wheel not forwarding the request to the parent window if ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollWithMouse is set. (#1463, #1380, #1502)
- Fixed a include build issue for Cygwin in non-POSIX (Win32) mode. (#1917, #1319, #276)
- ImDrawList: Improved handling for worst-case vertices reservation policy when large amount of text (e.g. 1+ million character strings)
  are being submitted in a single call. It would typically have crashed InputTextMultiline(). (#200)
- OS/Windows: Fixed missing ImmReleaseContext() call in the default Win32 IME handler. (#1932) [@vby]
- Metrics: Changed io.MetricsActiveWindows to reflect the number of active windows (!= from visible windows), which is useful
  for lazy/idle render mechanisms as new windows are typically not visible for one frame.
- Metrics: Added io.MetricsRenderWindow to reflect the number of visible windows.
- Metrics: Added io.MetricsActiveAllocations, moving away from the cross-context global counters than we previously used. (#1565, #1599, #586)
- Demo: Added basic Drag and Drop demo. (#143)
- Demo: Modified the Console example to use InsertChars() in the input text callback instead of poking directly into the buffer.
  Although this won't make a difference in the example itself, using InsertChars() will honor the resizing callback properly. (#2006, #1443, #1008).
- Demo: Clarified the use of IsItemHovered()/IsItemActive() right after being in the "Active, Focused, Hovered & Focused Tests" section.
- Examples: Tweaked the main.cpp of each example.
- Examples: Metal: Added Metal rendering backend. (#1929, #1873) [@warrenm]
- Examples: OSX: Added early raw OSX platform backend. (#1873) [@pagghiu, @itamago, @ocornut]
- Examples: Added mac OSX & iOS + Metal example in example_apple_metal/. (#1929, #1873) [@warrenm]
- Examples: Added mac OSX + OpenGL2 example in example_apple_opengl2/. (#1873)
- Examples: OpenGL3: Added shaders more versions of GLSL. (#1938, #1941, #1900, #1513, #1466, etc.)
- Examples: OpenGL3: Tweaked the imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp to work as-is with Emscripten + WebGL 2.0. (#1941). [@o-micron]
- Examples: OpenGL3: Made the example app default to GL 3.0 + GLSL 130 (instead of GL 3.2 + GLSL 150) unless on Mac.
- Examples: OpenGL3: Added error output when shaders fail to compile/link.
- Examples: OpenGL3: Added support for glew and glad OpenGL loaders out of the box. (#2001, #2002) [@jdumas]
- Examples: OpenGL2: Disabling/restoring GL_LIGHTING and GL_COLOR_MATERIAL to increase compatibility with legacy OpenGL applications. (#1996)
- Examples: DirectX10, DirectX11: Fixed unreleased resources in Init and Shutdown functions. (#1944)
- Examples: DirectX11: Querying for IDXGIFactory instead of IDXGIFactory1 to increase compatibility. (#1989) [@matt77hias]
- Examples: Vulkan: Fixed handling of VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::maxImageCount = 0 case. Tweaked present mode selections.
- Examples: Win32, Glfw, SDL: Added support for the ImGuiMouseCursor_Hand cursor.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.62 (Released 2018-06-22)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- TreeNodeEx(): The helper ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_CollapsingHeader flag now include ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NoTreePushOnOpen.
  The flag was already set by CollapsingHeader().
  The only difference is if you were using TreeNodeEx() manually with ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_CollapsingHeader and without
  ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NoTreePushOnOpen. In this case you can remove the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NoTreePushOnOpen flag from
  your call (ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_CollapsingHeader & ~ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NoTreePushOnOpen). (#1864)
  This also apply if you were using internal's TreeNodeBehavior() with the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_CollapsingHeader flag directly.
- ImFontAtlas: Renamed GetGlyphRangesChinese() to GetGlyphRangesChineseFull() to distinguish new smaller variants and
  discourage using the full set. (#1859)

Other Changes:

- Examples back-ends have been refactored to separate the platform code (e.g. Win32, Glfw, SDL2) from the renderer code (e.g. DirectX11, OpenGL3, Vulkan).
  The "Platform" bindings are in charge of: mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs, cursor shape, timing, etc.
  The "Renderer" bindings are in charge of: creating the main font texture, rendering imgui draw data.
      before: imgui_impl_dx11.cpp        --> after: imgui_impl_win32.cpp + imgui_impl_dx11.cpp
      before: imgui_impl_dx12.cpp        --> after: imgui_impl_win32.cpp + imgui_impl_dx12.cpp
      before: imgui_impl_glfw_gl3.cpp    --> after: imgui_impl_glfw.cpp + imgui_impl_opengl2.cpp
      before: imgui_impl_glfw_vulkan.cpp --> after: imgui_impl_glfw.cpp + imgui_impl_vulkan.cpp
      before: imgui_impl_sdl_gl3.cpp     --> after: imgui_impl_sdl2.cpp + imgui_impl_opengl2.cpp
      before: imgui_impl_sdl_gl3.cpp     --> after: imgui_impl_sdl2.cpp + imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp etc.
  - The idea is what we can now easily combine and maintain back-ends and reduce code redundancy. Individual files are
    smaller and more reusable. Integration of imgui into a new/custom engine may also be easier as there is less overlap
    between "windowing / inputs" and "rendering" code, so you may study or grab one half of the code and not the other.
  - This change was motivated by the fact that adding support for the upcoming multi-viewport feature requires more work
    from the Platform and Renderer back-ends, and the amount of redundancy across files was becoming too difficult to
    maintain. If you use default back-ends, you'll benefit from an easy update path to support multi-viewports later
    (for future ImGui 1.7x).
  - This is not strictly a breaking change if you keep your old bindings, but when you'll want to fully update your bindings,
    expect to have to reshuffle a few things.
  - Each example still has its own main.cpp which you may refer you to understand how to initialize and glue everything together.
  - Some frameworks (such as the Allegro, Marmalade) handle both the "platform" and "rendering" part, and your custom engine may as well.
  - Read examples/README.txt for details.
- Added IsItemDeactivated() to query if the last item was active previously and isn't anymore. Useful for Undo/Redo patterns. (#820, #956, #1875)
- Added IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() [*EDIT* renamed to IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() in 1.63] if the last item was active previously,
  is not anymore, and during its active state modified a value. Note that you may still get false positive (e.g. drag value and while
  holding return on the same value). (#820, #956, #1875)
- Nav: Added support for PageUp/PageDown (explorer-style: first aim at bottom/top most item, when scroll a page worth of contents). (#787)
- Nav: To keep the navigated item in view we also attempt to scroll the parent window as well as the current window. (#787)
- ColorEdit3, ColorEdit4, ColorButton: Added ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoDragDrop flag to disable ColorEditX as drag target and ColorButton as drag source. (#1826)
- BeginDragDropSource(): Offset tooltip position so it is off the mouse cursor, but also closer to it than regular tooltips,
  and not clamped by viewport. (#1739)
- BeginDragDropTarget(): Added ImGuiDragDropFlags_AcceptNoPreviewTooltip flag to request hiding the drag source tooltip
  from the target site. (#143)
- BeginCombo(), BeginMainMenuBar(), BeginChildFrame(): Temporary style modification are restored at the end of BeginXXX
  instead of EndXXX, to not affect tooltips and child windows.
- Popup: Improved handling of (erroneously) repeating calls to OpenPopup() to not close the popup's child popups. (#1497, #1533, #1865).
- InputTextMultiline(): Fixed double navigation highlight when scrollbar is active. (#787)
- InputText(): Fixed Undo corruption after pasting large amount of text (Redo will still fail when undo buffers are exhausted,
  but text won't be corrupted).
- SliderFloat(): When using keyboard/gamepad and a zero precision format string (e.g. "%.0f"), always step in integer units. (#1866)
- ImFontConfig: Added GlyphMinAdvanceX/GlyphMaxAdvanceX settings useful to make a font appears monospaced, particularly useful
  for icon fonts. (#1869)
- ImFontAtlas: Added GetGlyphRangesChineseSimplifiedCommon() helper that returns a list of ~2500 most common Simplified Chinese
  characters. (#1859) [@JX-Master, @ocornut]
- Examples: OSX: Added imgui_impl_osx.mm binding to be used along with e.g. imgui_impl_opengl2.cpp. (#281, #1870) [@pagghiu, @itamago, @ocornut]
- Examples: GLFW: Made it possible to Shutdown/Init the backend again (by reseting the time storage properly). (#1827) [@ice1000]
- Examples: Win32: Fixed handling of mouse wheel messages to support sub-unit scrolling messages (typically sent by track-pads). (#1874) [@zx64]
- Examples: SDL+Vulkan: Added SDL+Vulkan example.
- Examples: Allegro5: Added support for ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouseCursorChange flag. Added clipboard support.
- Examples: Allegro5: Unindexing buffers ourselves as Allegro indexed drawing primitives are buggy in the DirectX9 back-end
  (will be fixed in Allegro 5.2.5+).
- Examples: DirectX12: Moved the ID3D12GraphicsCommandList* parameter from ImGui_ImplDX12_NewFrame() to ImGui_ImplDX12_RenderDrawData() which makes a lots more sense. (#301)
- Examples: Vulkan: Reordered parameters ImGui_ImplVulkan_RenderDrawData() to be consistent with other bindings,
  a good occasion since we refactored the code.
- Examples: FreeGLUT: Added FreeGLUT bindings. Added FreeGLUT+OpenGL2 example. (#801)
- Examples: The functions in imgui_impl_xxx.cpp are prefixed with IMGUI_IMPL_API (which defaults to IMGUI_API) to facilitate
  some uses. (#1888)
- Examples: Fixed bindings to use ImGuiMouseCursor_COUNT instead of old name ImGuiMouseCursor_Count_ so they can compile
  with IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS. (#1887)
- Misc: Updated stb_textedit from 1.09 + patches to 1.12 + minor patches.
- Internals: PushItemFlag() flags are inherited by BeginChild().


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.61 (Released 2018-05-14)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking Changes:

- DragInt(): The default compile-time format string has been changed from "%.0f" to "%d", as we are not using integers internally
  any more. If you used DragInt() with custom format strings, make sure you change them to use %d or an integer-compatible format.
  To honor backward-compatibility, the DragInt() code will currently parse and modify format strings to replace %*f with %d,
  giving time to users to upgrade their code.
  If you have IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS enabled, the code will instead assert! You may run a reg-exp search on your
  codebase for e.g. "DragInt.*%f" to you find them.
- InputFloat(): Obsoleted InputFloat() functions taking an optional "int decimal_precision" in favor of an equivalent and more
  flexible "const char* format", consistent with other functions. Kept redirection functions (will obsolete).
- Misc: IM_DELETE() helper function added in 1.60 doesn't set the input pointer to NULL, more consistent with standard
  expectation and allows passing r-values.

Other Changes:

- Added DragScalar, DragScalarN: supports signed/unsigned, 32/64 bits, float/double data types. (#643, #320, #708, #1011)
- Added InputScalar, InputScalarN: supports signed/unsigned, 32/64 bits, float/double data types. (#643, #320, #708, #1011)
- Added SliderScalar, SliderScalarN: supports signed/unsigned, 32/64 bits, float/double data types. (#643, #320, #708, #1011)
- Window: Fixed pop-ups/tooltips/menus not honoring style.DisplaySafeAreaPadding as well as it should have (part of menus
  displayed outside the safe area, etc.).
- Window: Fixed windows using the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoSavedSettings flag from not using the same default position as other windows. (#1760)
- Window: Relaxed the internal stack size checker to allow Push/Begin/Pop/.../End patterns to be used with PushStyleColor, PushStyleVar, PushFont without causing a false positive assert. (#1767)
- Window: Fixed the default proportional item width lagging by one frame on resize.
- Columns: Fixed a bug introduced in 1.51 where columns would affect the contents size of their container, often creating
  feedback loops when ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize was used. (#1760)
- Settings: Fixed saving an empty .ini file if CreateContext/DestroyContext are called without a single call to NewFrame(). (#1741)
- Settings: Added LoadIniSettingsFromDisk(), LoadIniSettingsFromMemory(), SaveIniSettingsToDisk(), SaveIniSettingsToMemory()
  to manually load/save .ini settings. (#923, #993)
- Settings: Added io.WantSaveIniSettings flag, which is set to notify the application that e.g. SaveIniSettingsToMemory()
  should be called. (#923, #993)
- Scrolling: Fixed a case where using SetScrollHere(1.0f) at the bottom of a window on the same frame the window height
  has been growing would have the scroll clamped using the previous height. (#1804)
- MenuBar: Made BeginMainMenuBar() honor style.DisplaySafeAreaPadding so the text can be made visible on TV settings that
  don't display all pixels. (#1439) [@dougbinks]
- InputText: On Mac OS X, filter out characters when the CMD modifier is held. (#1747) [@sivu]
- InputText: On Mac OS X, support CMD+SHIFT+Z for Redo. CMD+Y is also supported as major apps seems to default to support both. (#1765) [@lfnoise]
- InputText: Fixed returning true when edition is cancelled with ESC and the current buffer matches the initial value.
- InputFloat,InputFloat2,InputFloat3,InputFloat4: Added variations taking a more flexible and consistent optional
  "const char* format" parameter instead of "int decimal_precision". This allow using custom formats to display values
  in scientific notation, and is generally more consistent with other API.
  Obsoleted functions using the optional "int decimal_precision" parameter. (#648, #712)
- DragFloat, DragInt: Cancel mouse tweak when current value is initially past the min/max boundaries and mouse is pushing
  in the same direction (keyboard/gamepad version already did this).
- DragFloat, DragInt: Honor natural type limits (e.g. INT_MAX, FLT_MAX) instead of wrapping around. (#708, #320)
- DragFloat, SliderFloat: Fixes to allow input of scientific notation numbers when using CTRL+Click to input the value. (~#648, #1011)
- DragFloat, SliderFloat: Rounding-on-write uses the provided format string instead of parsing the precision from the string,
  which allows for finer uses of %e %g etc. (#648, #642)
- DragFloat: Improved computation when using the power curve. Improved lost of input precision with very small steps.
  Added an assert than power-curve requires a min/max range. (~#642)
- DragFloat: The 'power' parameter is only honored if the min/max parameter are also setup.
- DragInt, SliderInt: Fixed handling of large integers (we previously passed data around internally as float, which reduced
  the range of valid integers).
- ColorEdit: Fixed not being able to pass the ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoAlpha or ImGuiColorEditFlags_HDR flags to SetColorEditOptions().
- Nav: Fixed hovering a Selectable() with the mouse so that it update the navigation cursor (as it happened in the pre-1.60 navigation branch). (#787)
- Style: Changed default style.DisplaySafeAreaPadding values from (4,4) to (3,3) so it is smaller than FramePadding and has no effect on main menu bar on a computer. (#1439)
- Fonts: When building font atlas, glyphs that are missing in the fonts are not using the glyph slot to render a dummy/default glyph. Saves space and allow merging fonts with
  overlapping font ranges such as FontAwesome5 which split out the Brands separately from the Solid fonts. (#1703, #1671)
- Misc: Added IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() macro to compare version string and data structure sizes in order to catch issues with mismatching compilation unit settings. (#1695, #1769)
- Misc: Added IMGUI_DISABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS in imconfig.h to make it easier to redefine wrappers for std/crt math functions.
- Misc: Fix to allow compiling in unity builds where stb_rectpack/stb_truetype may be already included in the same compilation unit.
- Demo: Simple Overlay: Added a context menu item to enable freely moving the window.
- Demo: Added demo for DragScalar(), InputScalar(), SliderScalar(). (#643)
- Examples: Calling IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() in the main.cpp of every example application.
- Examples: Allegro 5: Added support for 32-bit indices setup via defining ImDrawIdx, to avoid an unnecessary conversion (Allegro 5 doesn't support 16-bit indices).
- Examples: Allegro 5: Renamed bindings from imgui_impl_a5.cpp to imgui_impl_allegro5.cpp.
- Examples: DirectX 9: Saving/restoring Transform because they don't seem to be included in the StateBlock. Setting shading mode to Gouraud. (#1790, #1687) [@sr-tream]
- Examples: SDL: Fixed clipboard paste memory leak in the SDL binding code. (#1803) [@eliasdaler]
- Various minor fixes, tweaks, refactoring, comments.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.60 (Released 2018-04-07)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.60

The gamepad/keyboard navigation branch (which has been in the work since July 2016) has been merged.
Gamepad/keyboard navigation is still marked as Beta and has to be enabled explicitly.
Various internal refactoring have also been done, as part of the navigation work and as part of the upcoming viewport/docking work.

Breaking Changes:

- Obsoleted the io.RenderDrawListsFn callback, you can call your graphics engine render function after ImGui::Render().
  e.g. with example backends, call ImDrawData* draw_data = ImGui::GetDrawData(); ImGui_ImplXXXX_RenderDrawData(draw_data).
- Reorganized context handling to be more explicit: (#1599)
  - YOU NOW NEED TO CALL ImGui::CreateContext() AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR APP, AND CALL ImGui::DestroyContext() AT THE END.
  - removed Shutdown() function, as DestroyContext() serve this purpose. If you are using an old backend from the examples/ folder, remove the line that calls Shutdown().
  - you may pass a ImFontAtlas* pointer to CreateContext() to share a font atlas between contexts. Otherwise CreateContext() will create its own font atlas instance.
  - removed allocator parameters from CreateContext(), they are now setup with SetAllocatorFunctions(), and shared by all contexts.
  - removed the default global context and font atlas instance, which were confusing for users of DLL reloading and users of multiple contexts.
- Renamed ImGuiStyleVar_Count_ to ImGuiStyleVar_COUNT and ImGuiMouseCursor_Count_ to ImGuiMouseCursor_COUNT for consistency with other public enums.
- Fonts: Moved sample TTF files from extra_fonts/ to misc/fonts/. If you loaded files directly from the imgui repo you may need to update your paths.
- Fonts: changed ImFont::DisplayOffset.y to defaults to 0 instead of +1. Fixed vertical rounding of Ascent/Descent to match TrueType renderer.
  If you were adding or subtracting (not assigning) to ImFont::DisplayOffset check if your fonts are correctly aligned vertically. (#1619)
- BeginDragDropSource(): temporarily removed the optional mouse_button=0 parameter because it is not really usable in many situations at the moment.
- Obsoleted IsAnyWindowHovered() in favor of IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
- Obsoleted IsAnyWindowFocused() in favor of IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed io.WantMoveMouse to io.WantSetMousePos for consistency and ease of understanding (was added in 1.52, not used by core, and honored by some binding ahead of merging the Nav branch).
- Removed ImGuiCol_CloseButton, ImGuiCol_CloseButtonActive, ImGuiCol_CloseButtonHovered style colors as the closing cross uses regular button colors now.
- Renamed ImGuiSizeConstraintCallback to ImGuiSizeCallback, ImGuiSizeConstraintCallbackData to ImGuiSizeCallbackData.
- Removed CalcItemRectClosestPoint() which was weird and not really used by anyone except demo code. If you need it should be easy to replicate on your side (you can find the code in 1.53).
- [EDITED] Window: BeginChild() with an explicit name doesn't include the hash within the internal window name. (#1698)
  This change was erroneously introduced, undoing the change done for #894, #713, and not documented properly in the original
  1.60 release Changelog. It was fixed on 2018-09-28 (1.66) and I wrote this paragraph the same day.

Other Changes:

- Doc: Added a Changelog file in the repository to ease comparing versions (it goes back to dear imgui 1.48), until now it was only on GitHub.
- Navigation: merged in the gamepad/keyboard navigation (about a million changes!). (#787, #323)
  The initial focus was to support game controllers, but keyboard is becoming increasingly and decently usable.
- To use Gamepad Navigation:
  - Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad to enable.
  - Backend: Set io.BackendFlags |= ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad + fill the io.NavInputs[] fields before calling NewFrame(). Read imgui.cpp for more details.
  - See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1599 for recommended gamepad mapping or download PNG/PSD at http://goo.gl/9LgVZW
  - See 'enum ImGuiNavInput_' in imgui.h for a description of inputs. Read imgui.cpp for more details.
- To use Keyboard Navigation:
  - Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard to enable. NewFrame() will automatically fill io.NavInputs[] based on your io.KeysDown[] + io.KeyMap[] arrays.
  - Basic controls: arrows to navigate, Alt to enter menus, Space to activate item, Enter to edit text, Escape to cancel/close, Ctrl-Tab to focus windows, etc.
  - When keyboard navigation is active (io.NavActive + ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard), the io.WantCaptureKeyboard flag will be set.
    For more advanced uses, you may want to read from io.NavActive or io.NavVisible. Read imgui.cpp for more details.
- Navigation: SetItemDefaultFocus() sets the navigation position in addition to scrolling. (#787)
- Navigation: Added IsItemFocused(), added IsAnyItemFocused(). (#787)
- Navigation: Added window flags: ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNav (== ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs | ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavFocus).
- Navigation: Style: Added ImGuiCol_NavHighlight, ImGuiCol_NavWindowingHighlight colors. (#787)
- Navigation: TreeNode: Added ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NavLeftJumpsBackHere flag to allow Nav Left direction to jump back to parent tree node from any of its child. (#1079)
- Navigation: IO: Added io.ConfigFlags (input), io.NavActive (output), io.NavVisible (output). (#787)
- Context: Removed the default global context and font atlas instances, which caused various problems to users of multiple contexts and DLL users. (#1565, #1599)
  YOU NOW NEED TO CALL ImGui::CreateContext() AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR APP, AND CALL ImGui::DestroyContext() AT THE END. Existing apps will assert/crash without it.
- Context: Added SetAllocatorFunctions() to rewire memory allocators (as a replacement to previous parameters to CreateContext()). Allocators are shared by all contexts and imgui helpers. (#1565, #586, #992, #1007, #1558)
- Context: You may pass a ImFontAtlas to CreateContext() to specify a font atlas to share. Shared font atlas are not owned by the context and not destroyed along with it. (#1599)
- Context: Added IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATORS to disable linking with malloc/free. (#1565, #586, #992, #1007, #1558)
- IO: Added io.ConfigFlags for user application to store settings for imgui and for the backend:
  - ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard: Enable keyboard navigation.
  - ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad: Enable gamepad navigation (provided ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad is also set by backend).
  - ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos: Instruct navigation to move the mouse cursor. May be useful on TV/console systems where moving a virtual mouse is awkward.
  - ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouseCursorChange: Instruct backend to not alter mouse cursor shape and visibility (by default the example backend use mouse cursor API of the platform when available)
  - ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouse: Instruct imgui to clear mouse position/buttons in NewFrame(). This allows ignoring the mouse information passed by the backend.
  - ImGuiConfigFlags_IsSRGB, ImGuiConfigFlags_IsTouchScreen: Flags for general application use.
- IO: Added io.BackendFlags for backend to store its capabilities (currently: _HasGamepad, _HasMouseCursors, _HasSetMousePos). This will be used more in the next version.
- IO: Added ImGuiKey_Insert, ImGuiKey_Space keys. Setup in all example bindings. (#1541)
- IO: Added Horizontal Mouse Wheel support for horizontal scrolling. (#1463) [@tseeker]
- IO: Added IsAnyMouseDown() helper which is helpful for bindings to handle mouse capturing.
- Window: Clicking on a window with the ImGuiWIndowFlags_NoMove flags takes an ActiveId so we can't hover something else when dragging afterwards. (#1381, #1337)
- Window: IsWindowHovered(): Added ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow, ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow flags (See Breaking Changes). Added to demo. (#1382)
- Window: Added SetNextWindowBgAlpha() helper. Particularly helpful since the legacy 5-parameters version of Begin() has been marked as obsolete in 1.53. (#1567)
- Window: Fixed SetNextWindowContentSize() with 0.0f on Y axis (or SetNextWindowContentWidth()) overwriting the contents size. Got broken on Dec 10 (1.53). (#1363)
- ArrowButton: Added ArrowButton() given a cardinal direction (e.g. ImGuiDir_Left).
- InputText: Added alternative clipboard shortcuts: Shift+Delete (cut), CTRL+Insert (copy), Shift+Insert (paste). (#1541)
- InputText: Fixed losing Cursor X position when clicking outside on an item that's submitted after the InputText(). It was only noticeable when restoring focus programmatically. (#1418, #1554)
- InputText: Added ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsScientific flag to also allow 'e'/'E' for input of values using scientific notation. Automatically used by InputFloat.
- Style: Default style is now StyleColorsDark(), instead of the old StyleColorsClassic(). (#707)
- Style: Enable window border by default. (#707)
- Style: Exposed ImGuiStyleVar_WindowTitleAlign, ImGuiStyleVar_ScrollbarSize, ImGuiStyleVar_ScrollbarRounding, ImGuiStyleVar_GrabRounding + added an assert to reduce accidental breakage. (#1181)
- Style: Added style.MouseCursorScale help when using the software mouse cursor facility. (#939).
- Style: Close button nows display a cross before hovering. Fixed cross positioning being a little off. Uses button colors for highlight when hovering. (#707)
- Popup: OpenPopup() Always reopen existing pop-ups. (Removed imgui_internal.h's OpenPopupEx() which was used for this.) (#1497, #1533).
- Popup: BeginPopupContextItem(), BeginPopupContextWindow(), BeginPopupContextVoid(), OpenPopupOnItemClick() all react on mouse release instead of mouse press. (~#439)
- Popup: Better handling of user mistakenly calling OpenPopup() every frame (with reopen_existing option). The error will now be more visible and easier to understand. (#1497)
- Popup: BeginPopup(): Exposed extra_flags parameter that are passed through to Begin(). (#1533)
- Popup: BeginPopupModal: fixed the conditional test for SetNextWindowPos() which was polling the wrong window, which in practice made the test succeed all the time.
- Tooltip: BeginTooltip() sets ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs flag.
- Scrollbar: Fixed ScrollbarY enable test after ScrollbarX has been enabled being a little off (small regression from Nov 2017). (#1574)
- Scrollbar: Fixed ScrollbarX enable test subtracting WindowPadding.x (this has been there since the addition of horizontal scroll bar!).
- Columns: Clear offsets data when columns count changed. (#1525)
- Columns: Fixed a memory leak of ImGuiColumnsSet's Columns vector. (#1529) [@unprompted]
- Columns: Fixed resizing a window very small breaking some columns positioning (broken in 1.53).
- Columns: The available column extent takes consideration of the right-most clipped pixel, so the right-most column may look a little wider but will contain the same amount of visible contents.
- MenuBar: Fixed menu bar pushing a clipping rect outside of its allocated bound (usually unnoticeable).
- TreeNode: nodes with the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_Leaf flag correctly disable highlight when DragDrop is active. (#143, #581)
- Drag and Drop: Increased payload type string to 32 characters instead of 8. (#143)
- Drag and Drop: TreeNode as drop target displays rectangle over full frame. (#1597, #143)
- DragFloat: Fix/workaround for backends which do not preserve a valid mouse position when dragged out of bounds. (#1559)
- InputFloat: Allow inputing value using scientific notation e.g. "1e+10".
- InputDouble: Added InputDouble() function. We use a format string instead of a decimal_precision parameter to also for "%e" and variants. (#1011)
- Slider, Combo: Use ImGuiCol_FrameBgHovered color when hovered. (#1456) [@stfx]
- Combo: BeginCombo(): Added ImGuiComboFlags_NoArrowButton to disable the arrow button and only display the wide value preview box.
- Combo: BeginCombo(): Added ImGuiComboFlags_NoPreview to disable the preview and only display a square arrow button.
- Combo: Arrow button isn't displayed over frame background so its blended color matches other buttons. Left side of the button isn't rounded.
- PlotLines: plot a flat line if scale_min==scale_max. (#1621)
- Fonts: Changed DisplayOffset.y to defaults to 0 instead of +1. Fixed rounding of Ascent/Descent to match TrueType renderer.
  If you were adding or subtracting (not assigning) to ImFont::DisplayOffset check if your fonts are correctly aligned vertically. (#1619)
- Fonts: Updated stb_truetype from 1.14 to stb_truetype 1.19. (w/ include fix from some platforms #1622)
- Fonts: Added optional FreeType rasterizer in misc/freetype. Moved from imgui_club repo. (#618) [@Vuhdo, @mikesart, @ocornut]
- Fonts: Moved extra_fonts/ to misc/fonts/.
- ImFontAtlas: Fixed cfg.MergeMode not reusing existing glyphs if available (always overwrote).
- ImFontAtlas: Handle stb_truetype stbtt_InitFont() and stbtt_PackBegin() possible failures more gracefully, GetTexDataAsRGBA32() won't crash during conversion. (#1527)
- ImFontAtlas: Moved mouse cursor data out of ImGuiContext, fix drawing them with multiple contexts. Also remove the last remaining undesirable dependency on ImGui in imgui_draw.cpp. (#939)
- ImFontAtlas: Added ImFontAtlasFlags_NoPowerOfTwoHeight flag to disable padding font height to nearest power of two. (#1613)
- ImFontAtlas: Added ImFontAtlasFlags_NoMouseCursors flag to disable baking software mouse cursors, mostly to save texture memory on very low end hardware. (#1613)
- ImDrawList: Fixed AddRect() with anti-aliasing disabled (lower-right corner pixel was often missing, rounding looks a little better.) (#1646)
- ImDrawList: Added CloneOutput() helper to facilitate the cloning of ImDrawData or ImDrawList for multi-threaded rendering.
- Misc: Functions passed to libc qsort are explicitly marked cdecl to support compiling with vectorcall as the default calling convention. (#1230, #1611) [@RandyGaul]
- Misc: ImVec2: added [] operator. This is becoming desirable for some code working of either axes independently. Better adding it sooner than later.
- Misc: NewFrame(): Added an assert to detect incorrect filling of the io.KeyMap[] array earlier. (#1555)
- Misc: Added IM_OFFSETOF() helper in imgui.h (previously was in imgui_internal.h)
- Misc: Added IM_NEW(), IM_DELETE() helpers in imgui.h (previously were in imgui_internal.h)
- Misc: Added obsolete redirection function GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing() (which redirects to GetFrameHeightWithSpacing()), as intended and stated in docs of 1.53.
- Misc: Added misc/natvis/imgui.natvis for visual studio debugger users to easily visualize imgui internal types. Added to examples projects.
- Misc: Added IMGUI_USER_CONFIG to define a custom configuration filename. (#255, #1573, #1144, #41)
- Misc: Added IMGUI_STB_TRUETYPE_FILENAME and IMGUI_STB_RECT_PACK_FILENAME compile time directives to use another version of the stb_ files.
- Misc: Updated stb_rect_pack from 0.10 to 0.11 (minor changes).
  (Those flags are not used by ImGui itself, they only exists to make it easy for the engine/backend to pass information to the application in a standard manner.)
- Metrics: Added display of Columns state.
- Demo: Improved Selectable() examples. (#1528)
- Demo: Tweaked the Child demos, added a menu bar to the second child to test some navigation functions.
- Demo: Console: Using ImGuiCol_Text to be more friendly to color changes.

- Examples: Using Dark theme by default. (#707). Tweaked demo code.
- Examples: Added support for horizontal mouse wheel for API that allows it. (#1463) [@tseeker]
- Examples: All examples now setup the io.BackendFlags to signify they can honor mouse cursors, gamepad, etc.
- Examples: DirectX10: Fixed erroneous call to io.Fonts->ClearInputData() + ClearTexData() that was left in DX10 example but removed in 1.47 (Nov 2015) in every other backends. (#1733)

 VERSION 1.53 (Released 2017-12-25)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.53

Breaking Changes:

- Renamed the emblematic `ShowTestWindow()` function to `ShowDemoWindow()`. Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed `GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing()` to `GetFrameHeightWithSpacing()` for consistency. Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlapMode` flag to `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap`. Kept redirection enum (will obsolete).
- Obsoleted `IsRootWindowFocused()` in favor of using `IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootWindow)`. Kept redirection function (will obsolete). (#1382)
- Obsoleted `IsRootWindowOrAnyChildFocused()` in favor of using `IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootAndChildWindows)`. Kept redirection function (will obsolete). (#1382)
- Obsoleted `IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered()` in favor of using `IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootAndChildWindows)`. Kept redirection function (will obsolete). (#1382)
- Obsoleted `SetNextWindowContentWidth() in favor of using `SetNextWindowContentSize()`. Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed `ImGuiTextBuffer::append()` helper to `appendf()`, and `appendv()` to `appendfv()` for consistency. If you copied the 'Log' demo in your code, it uses appendv() so that needs to be renamed.
- ImDrawList: Removed 'bool anti_aliased = true' final parameter of `ImDrawList::AddPolyline()` and `ImDrawList::AddConvexPolyFilled()`. Prefer manipulating ImDrawList::Flags if you need to toggle them during the frame.
- Style, ImDrawList: Renamed `style.AntiAliasedShapes` to `style.AntiAliasedFill` for consistency and as a way to explicitly break code that manipulate those flag at runtime. You can now manipulate ImDrawList::Flags.
- Style, Begin: Removed `ImGuiWindowFlags_ShowBorders` window flag. Borders are now fully set up in the ImGuiStyle structure (see e.g. `style.FrameBorderSize`, `style.WindowBorderSize`, `style.PopupBorderSize`).
  Use `ImGui::ShowStyleEditor()` to look them up.
  Please note that the style system will keep evolving (hopefully stabilizing in Q1 2018), and so custom styles will probably subtly break over time.
  It is recommended that you use the `StyleColorsClassic()`, `StyleColorsDark()`, `StyleColorsLight()` functions. Also see `ShowStyleSelector()`.
- Style: Removed `ImGuiCol_ComboBg` in favor of combo boxes using `ImGuiCol_PopupBg` for consistency. Combo are normal pop-ups.
- Style: Renamed `ImGuiCol_ChildWindowBg` to `ImGuiCol_ChildBg`.
- Style: Renamed `style.ChildWindowRounding` to `style.ChildRounding`, `ImGuiStyleVar_ChildWindowRounding` to `ImGuiStyleVar_ChildRounding`.
- Removed obsolete redirection functions: SetScrollPosHere() - marked obsolete in v1.42, July 2015.
- Removed obsolete redirection functions: GetWindowFont(), GetWindowFontSize() - marked obsolete in v1.48, March 2016.

Other Changes:

- Added `io.OptCursorBlink` option to allow disabling cursor blinking. (#1427) [renamed to io.ConfigCursorBlink in 1.63]
- Added `GetOverlayDrawList()` helper to quickly get access to a ImDrawList that will be rendered in front of every windows.
- Added `GetFrameHeight()` helper which returns `(FontSize + style.FramePadding.y * 2)`.
- Drag and Drop: Added Beta API to easily use drag and drop patterns between imgui widgets.
  - Setup a source on a widget with `BeginDragDropSource()`, `SetDragDropPayload()`, `EndDragDropSource()` functions.
  - Receive data with `BeginDragDropTarget()`, `AcceptDragDropPayload()`, `EndDragDropTarget()`.
  - See ImGuiDragDropFlags for various options.
  - The ColorEdit4() and ColorButton() widgets now support Drag and Drop.
  - The API is tagged as Beta as it still may be subject to small changes.
- Drag and Drop: When drag and drop is active, tree nodes and collapsing header can be opened by hovering on them for 0.7 seconds.
- Renamed io.OSXBehaviors to io.OptMacOSXBehaviors. Should not affect users as the compile-time default is usually enough. (#473, #650)
- Style: Added StyleColorsDark() style. (#707) [@dougbinks]
- Style: Added StyleColorsLight() style. Best used with frame borders + thicker font than the default font. (#707)
- Style: Added style.PopupRounding setting. (#1112)
- Style: Added style.FrameBorderSize, style.WindowBorderSize, style.PopupBorderSize. Removed ImGuiWindowFlags_ShowBorders window flag!
  Borders are now fully set up in the ImGuiStyle structure. Use ImGui::ShowStyleEditor() to look them up. (#707, fix #819, #1031)
- Style: Various small changes to the classic style (most noticeably, buttons are now using blue shades). (#707)
- Style: Renamed ImGuiCol_ChildWindowBg to ImGuiCol_ChildBg.
- Style: Renamed style.ChildWindowRounding to style.ChildRounding, ImGuiStyleVar_ChildWindowRounding to ImGuiStyleVar_ChildRounding.
- Style: Removed ImGuiCol_ComboBg in favor of combo boxes using ImGuiCol_PopupBg for consistency. (#707)
- Style: Made the ScaleAllSizes() helper rounds down every values so they are aligned on integers.
- Focus: Added SetItemDefaultFocus(), which in the current (master) branch behave the same as doing `if (IsWindowAppearing()) SetScrollHere()`.
  In the navigation branch this will also set the default focus. Prefer using this when creating combo boxes with `BeginCombo()` so your code will be forward-compatible with gamepad/keyboard navigation features. (#787)
- Combo: Pop-up grows horizontally to accommodate for contents that is larger then the parent combo button.
- Combo: Added BeginCombo()/EndCombo() API which allows use to submit content of any form and manage your selection state without relying on indices.
- Combo: Added ImGuiComboFlags_PopupAlignLeft flag to BeginCombo() to prioritize keeping the pop-up on the left side (for small-button-looking combos).
- Combo: Added ImGuiComboFlags_HeightSmall, ImGuiComboFlags_HeightLarge, ImGuiComboFlags_HeightLargest to easily provide desired pop-up height.
- Combo: You can use SetNextWindowSizeConstraints() before BeginCombo() to specify specific pop-up width/height constraints.
- Combo: Offset popup position by border size so that a double border isn't so visible. (#707)
- Combo: Recycling windows by using a stack number instead of a unique id, wasting less memory (like menus do).
- InputText: Added ImGuiInputTextFlags_NoUndoRedo flag. (#1506, #1508) [@ibachar]
- Window: Fixed auto-resize allocating too much space for scrollbar when SizeContents is bigger than maximum window size (fixes c0547d3). (#1417)
- Window: Child windows with MenuBar use regular WindowPadding.y so layout look consistent as child or as a regular window.
- Window: Begin(): Fixed appending into a child window with a second Begin() from a different window stack querying the wrong window for the window->Collapsed test.
- Window: Calling IsItemActive(), IsItemHovered() etc. after a call to Begin() provides item data for the title bar, so you can easily test if the title bar is being hovered, etc. (#823)
- Window: Made it possible to use SetNextWindowPos() on a child window.
- Window: Fixed a one frame glitch. When an appearing window claimed the focus themselves, the title bar wouldn't use the focused color for one frame.
- Window: Added ImGuiWindowFlags_ResizeFromAnySide flag to resize from any borders or from the lower-left corner of a window. This requires your backend to honor GetMouseCursor() requests for full usability. (#822)
- Window: Sizing fixes when using SetNextWindowSize() on individual axises.
- Window: Hide new window for one frame until they calculate their size. Also fixes SetNextWindowPos() given a non-zero pivot. (#1694)
- Window: Made mouse wheel scrolling accommodate better to windows that are smaller than the scroll step.
- Window: SetNextWindowContentSize() adjust for the size of decorations (title bar/menu bar), but _not_ for borders are we consistently make borders not affect layout.
  If you need a non-child window of an exact size with border enabled but zero window padding, you'll need to accommodate for the border size yourself.
- Window: Using the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollWithMouse flag on a child window forwards the mouse wheel event to the parent window, unless either ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs or ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollbar are also set. (#1380, #1502)
- Window: Active Modal window always set the WantCaptureKeyboard flag. (#744)
- Window: Moving window doesn't use accumulating MouseDelta so straying out of imgui boundaries keeps moved imgui window at the same cursor-relative position.
- IsWindowFocused(): Added ImGuiFocusedFlags_ChildWindows flag to include child windows in the focused test. (#1382).
- IsWindowFocused(): Added ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootWindow flag to start focused test from the root (top-most) window. Obsolete IsRootWindowFocused(). (#1382)
- IsWindowHovered(): Added ImGuiHoveredFlags_ChildWindows flag to include child windows in the hovered test. (#1382).
- IsWindowHovered(): Added ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootWindow flag to start hovered test from the root (top-most) window. The combination of both flags obsoletes IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered(). (#1382)
- IsWindowHovered(): Fixed return value when an item is active to use the same logic as IsItemHovered(). (#1382, #1404)
- IsWindowHovered(): Always return true when current window is being moved. (#1382)
- Scrollbar: Fixed issues with vertical scrollbar flickering/appearing, typically when manually resizing and using a pattern of filling available height (e.g. full sized BeginChild).
- Scrollbar: Minor graphical fix for when scrollbar don't have enough visible space to display the full grab.
- Scrolling: Fixed padding and scrolling asymmetry where lower/right sides of a window wouldn't use WindowPadding properly + causing minor scrolling glitches.
- Tree: TreePush with zero arguments was ambiguous. Resolved by making it call TreePush(const void*). [@JasonWilkins]
- Tree: Renamed ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlapMode to ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap. (#600, #1330)
- MenuBar: Fixed minor rendering issues on the right size when resizing a window very small and using rounded window corners.
- MenuBar: better software clipping to handle small windows, in particular child window don't have minimum constraints so we need to render clipped menus better.
- BeginMenu(): Tweaked the Arrow/Triangle displayed on child menu items.
- Columns: Clipping columns borders on Y axis on CPU because some Linux GPU drivers appears to be unhappy with triangle spanning large regions. (#125)
- Columns: Added ImGuiColumnsFlags_GrowParentContentsSize to internal API to restore old content sizes behavior (may be obsolete). (#1444, #125)
- Columns: Columns width is no longer lost when dragging a column to the right side of the window, until releasing the mouse button you have a chance to save them. (#1499, #125). [@ggtucker]
- Columns: Fixed dragging when using a same of columns multiple times in the frame. (#125)
- Indent(), Unindent(): Allow passing negative values.
- ColorEdit4(): Made IsItemActive() return true when picker pop-up is active. (#1489)
- ColorEdit4(): Tweaked tooltip so that the color button aligns more correctly with text.
- ColorEdit4(): Support drag and drop. Color buttons can be used as drag sources, and ColorEdit widgets as drag targets. (#143)
- ColorPicker4(): Fixed continuously returning true when holding mouse button on the sat/value/alpha locations. We only return true on value change. (#1489)
- NewFrame(): using literal strings in the most-frequently firing IM_ASSERT expressions to increase the odd of programmers seeing them (especially those who don't use a debugger).
- NewFrame() now asserts if neither Render or EndFrame have been called. Exposed EndFrame(). Made it legal to call EndFrame() more than one. (#1423)
- ImGuiStorage: Added BuildSortByKey() helper to rebuild storage from scratch.
- ImFont: Added GetDebugName() helper.
- ImFontAtlas: Added missing Thai punctuation in the GetGlyphRangesThai() ranges. (#1396) [@nProtect]
- ImDrawList: Removed 'bool anti_aliased = true' final parameter of ImDrawList::AddPolyline() and ImDrawList::AddConvexPolyFilled(). Anti-aliasing is controlled via the regular style.AntiAliased flags.
- ImDrawList: Added ImDrawList::AddImageRounded() helper. (#845) [@thedmd]
- ImDrawList: Refactored to make ImDrawList independent of ImGui. Removed static variable in PathArcToFast() which caused linking issues to some.
- ImDrawList: Exposed ImDrawCornerFlags, replaced occurrences of ~0 with an explicit ImDrawCornerFlags_All. NB: Inversed BotLeft (prev 1<<3, now 1<<2) and BotRight (prev 1<<2, now 1<<3).
- ImVector: Added ImVector::push_front() helper.
- ImVector: Added ImVector::contains() helper.
- ImVector: insert() uses grow_capacity() instead of using grow policy inconsistent with push_back().
- Internals: Remove requirement to define IMGUI_DEFINE_PLACEMENT_NEW to use the IM_PLACEMENT_NEW macro. (#1103)
- Internals: ButtonBehavior: Fixed ImGuiButtonFlags_NoHoldingActiveID flag from incorrectly setting the ActiveIdClickOffset field.
  This had no known effect within imgui code but could have affected custom drag and drop patterns. And it is more correct this way! (#1418)
- Internals: ButtonBehavior: Fixed ImGuiButtonFlags_AllowOverlapMode to avoid temporarily activating widgets on click before they have been correctly double-hovered. (#319, #600)
- Internals: Added SplitterBehavior() helper. (#319)
- Internals: Added IM_NEW(), IM_DELETE() helpers. (#484, #504, #1517)
- Internals: Basic refactor of the settings API which now allows external elements to be loaded/saved.
- Demo: Added ShowFontSelector() showing loaded fonts.
- Demo: Added ShowStyleSelector() to select among default styles. (#707)
- Demo: Renamed the emblematic ShowTestWindow() function to ShowDemoWindow().
- Demo: Style Editor: Added a "Simplified settings" sections with check-boxes for border size and frame rounding. (#707, #1019)
- Demo: Style Editor: Added combo box to select stock styles and select current font when multiple are loaded. (#707)
- Demo: Style Editor: Using local storage so Save/Revert button makes more sense without code passing its storage. Added horizontal scroll bar. Fixed Save/Revert button to be always accessible. (#1211)
- Demo: Console: Fixed context menu issue. (#1404)
- Demo: Console: Fixed incorrect positioning which was hidden by a minor scroll issue (this would affect people who copied the Console code as is).
- Demo: Constrained Resize: Added more test cases. (#1417)
- Demo: Custom Rendering: Fixed clipping rectangle extruding out of parent window.
- Demo: Layout: Removed unnecessary and misleading BeginChild/EndChild calls.

- Demo: Display better mouse cursor info for debugging backends.
- Demo: Stopped using rand() function in demo code.
- Examples: Added a handful of extra comments (about fonts, third-party libraries used in the examples, etc.).
- Examples: DirectX9: Handle loss of D3D9 device (D3DERR_DEVICELOST). (#1464)
- Examples: Added null_example/ which is helpful for quick testing on multiple compilers/settings without relying on graphics library.
- Fix for using alloca() in "Clang with Microsoft Codechain" mode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.52 (2017-10-27)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.52

Breaking Changes:

- IO: `io.MousePos` needs to be set to ImVec2(-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX) when mouse is unavailable/missing, instead of ImVec2(-1,-1) as previously) This is needed so we can clear `io.MouseDelta` field when the mouse is made available again.
- Renamed `AlignFirstTextHeightToWidgets()` to `AlignTextToFramePadding()`. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Obsoleted the legacy 5 parameters version of Begin(). Please avoid using it. If you need a transparent window background, uses `PushStyleColor()`. The old size parameter there was also misleading and equivalent to calling `SetNextWindowSize(size, ImGuiCond_FirstTimeEver)`. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Obsoleted `IsItemHoveredRect()`, `IsMouseHoveringWindow()` in favor of using the newly introduced flags of `IsItemHovered()` and `IsWindowHovered()`. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete). (#1382)
- Obsoleted 'SetNextWindowPosCenter()' in favor of using 1SetNextWindowPos()` with a pivot value which allows to do the same and more. Keep inline redirection function.
- Removed `IsItemRectHovered()`, `IsWindowRectHovered()` recently introduced in 1.51 which were merely the more consistent/correct names for the above functions which are now obsolete anyway. (#1382)
- Changed `IsWindowHovered()` default parameters behavior to return false if an item is active in another window (e.g. click-dragging item from another window to this window). You can use the newly introduced IsWindowHovered() flags to requests this specific behavior if you need it. (#1382)
- Renamed imconfig.h's `IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCS`/`IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCS` to `IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCTIONS`/`IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCTIONS` for consistency.
- Renamed ImFont::Glyph to ImFontGlyph. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).

Other Changes:

- ProgressBar: fixed rendering when straddling rounded area. (#1296)
- SliderFloat, DragFloat: Using scientific notation e.g. "%.1e" in the displayed format string doesn't mistakenly trigger rounding of the value. [@MomentsInGraphics]
- Combo, InputFloat, InputInt: Made the small button on the right side align properly with the equivalent colored button of ColorEdit4().
- IO: Tweaked logic for `io.WantCaptureMouse` so it now outputs false when e.g. hovering over void while an InputText() is active. (#621) [@pdoane]
- IO: Fixed `io.WantTextInput` from mistakenly outputting true when an activated Drag or Slider was previously turned into an InputText(). (#1317)
- Misc: Added flags to `IsItemHovered()`, `IsWindowHovered()` to access advanced hovering-test behavior. Generally useful for pop-ups and drag and drop behaviors: (relates to ~#439, #1013, #143, #925)
  - `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup`
  - `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem`
  - `ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenOverlapped`
  - `ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly`
- Input: Added `IsMousePosValid()` helper.
- Input: Added `GetKeyPressedAmount()` to easily measure press count when the repeat rate is faster than the frame rate.
- Input/Focus: Disabled TAB and Shift+TAB when CTRL key is held.
- CheckBox: Now rendering a tick mark instead of a full square.
- ColorEdit4: Added "Copy as..." option in context menu. (#346)
- ColorPicker: Improved ColorPicker hue wheel color interpolation. (#1313) [@thevaber]
- ColorButton: Reduced bordering artifact that would be particularly visible with an opaque Col_FrameBg and FrameRounding enabled.
- ColorButton: Fixed rendering color button with a checkerboard if the transparency comes from the global style.Alpha and not from the actual source color.
- TreeNode: Added `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_FramePadding` flag to conveniently create a tree node with full padding at the beginning of a line, without having to call `AlignTextToFramePadding()`.
- Trees: Fixed calling `SetNextTreeNodeOpen()` on a collapsed window leaking to the first tree node item of the next frame.
- Layout: Horizontal layout is automatically enforced in a menu bar, so you can use non-MenuItem elements without calling SameLine().
- Separator: Output a vertical separator when used inside a menu bar (or in general when horizontal layout is active, but that isn't exposed yet!).
- Window: Added `IsWindowAppearing()` helper (helpful e.g. as a condition before initializing some of your own things.).
- Window: Added pivot parameter to `SetNextWindowPos()`, making it possible to center or right align a window. Obsoleted `SetNextWindowPosCenter()`.
- Window: Fixed title bar color of top-most window under a modal window.
- Window: Fixed not being able to move a window by clicking on one of its child window. (#1337, #635)
- Window: Fixed `Begin()` auto-fit calculation code that predict the presence of a scrollbar so it works better when window size constraints are used.
- Window: Fixed calling `Begin()` more than once per frame setting `window_just_activated_by_user` which in turn would set enable the Appearing condition for that frame.
- Window: The implicit "Debug" window now uses a "Debug##Default" identifier instead of "Debug" to allow user creating a window called "Debug" without losing their custom flags.
- Window: Made the `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMove` flag properly inherited from parent to child. In a setup with ParentWindow (no flag) -> Child (NoMove) -> SubChild (no flag), the user won't be able to move the parent window by clicking on SubChild. (#1381)
- Popups: Pop-ups can be closed with a right-click anywhere, without altering focus under the pop-up. (~#439)
- Popups: `BeginPopupContextItem()`, `BeginPopupContextWindow()` are now setup to allow reopening a context menu by right-clicking again. (~#439)
- Popups: `BeginPopupContextItem()` now supports a NULL string identifier and uses the last item ID if available.
- Popups: Added `OpenPopupOnItemClick()` helper which mimic `BeginPopupContextItem()` but doesn't do the BeginPopup().
- MenuItem: Only activating on mouse release. [@Urmeli0815] (was already fixed in nav branch).
- MenuItem: Made tick mark thicker (thick mark?).
- MenuItem: Tweaks to be usable inside a menu bar (nb: it looks like a regular menu and thus is misleading, prefer using Button() and regular widgets in menu bar if you need to). (#1387)
- ImDrawList: Fixed a rare draw call merging bug which could lead to undisplayed triangles. (#1172, #1368)
- ImDrawList: Fixed a rare bug in `ChannelsMerge()` when all contents has been clipped, leading to an extraneous draw call being created. (#1172, #1368)
- ImFont: Added `AddGlyph()` building helper for use by custom atlas builders.
- ImFontAtlas: Added support for CustomRect API to submit custom rectangles to be packed into the atlas. You can map them as font glyphs, or use them for custom purposes.
  After the atlas is built you can query the position of your rectangles in the texture and then copy your data there. You can use this features to create e.g. full color font-mapped icons.
- ImFontAtlas: Fixed fall-back handling when merging fonts, if a glyph was missing from the second font input it could have used a glyph from the first one. (#1349) [@inolen]
- ImFontAtlas: Fixed memory leak on build failure case when stbtt_InitFont failed (generally due to incorrect or supported font type). (#1391) (@Moka42)
- ImFontConfig: Added `RasterizerMultiply` option to alter the brightness of individual fonts at rasterization time, which may help increasing readability for some.
- ImFontConfig: Added `RasterizerFlags` to pass options to custom rasterizer (e.g. the [imgui_freetype](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui_club/tree/master/imgui_freetype) rasterizer in imgui_club has such options).
- ImVector: added resize() variant with initialization value.
- Misc: Changed the internal name formatting of child windows identifier to use slashes (instead of dots) as separator, more readable.
- Misc: Fixed compilation with `IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` defined.
- Misc: Marked all format+va_list functions with format attribute so GCC/Clang can warn about misuses.
- Misc: Fixed compilation on NetBSD due to missing alloca.h (#1319) [@RyuKojiro]
- Misc: Improved warnings compilation for newer versions of Clang. (#1324) (@waywardmonkeys)
- Misc: Added `io.WantMoveMouse flags` (from Nav branch) and honored in Examples applications. Currently unused but trying to spread Examples applications code that supports it.
- Misc: Added `IMGUI_DISABLE_FORMAT_STRING_FUNCTIONS` support in imconfig.h to allow user reimplementing the `ImFormatString()` functions e.g. to use stb_printf(). (#1038)
- Misc: [Windows] Fixed default Win32 `SetClipboardText()` handler leaving the Win32 clipboard handler unclosed on failure. [@pdoane]
- Style: Added `ImGuiStyle::ScaleAllSizes(float)` helper to make it easier to have application transition e.g. from low to high DPI with a matching style.
- Metrics: Draw window bounding boxes when hovering Pos/Size; List all draw layers; Trimming empty commands like Render() does.
- Examples: OpenGL3: Save and restore sampler state. (#1145) [@nlguillemot]
- Examples: OpenGL2, OpenGL3: Save and restore polygon mode. (#1307) [@JJscott]
- Examples: DirectX11: Allow creating device with feature level 10 since we don't really need much for that example. (#1333)
- Examples: DirectX9/10/12: Using the Win32 SetCapture/ReleaseCapture API to read mouse coordinates when they are out of bounds. (#1375) [@Gargaj, @ocornut]
- Tools: Fixed binary_to_compressed_c tool to return 0 when successful. (#1350) [@benvanik]
- Internals: Exposed more helpers and unfinished features in imgui_internal.h. (use at your own risk!).
- Internals: A bunch of internal refactoring, hopefully haven't broken anything! Merged a bunch of internal changes from the upcoming Navigation branch.
- Various tweaks, fixes and documentation changes.

Beta Navigation Branch:
(Lots of work has been done toward merging the Beta Gamepad/Keyboard Navigation branch (#787) in master.)
(Please note that this branch is always kept up to date with master. If you are using the navigation branch, some of the changes include:)
- Nav: Added `#define IMGUI_HAS_NAV` in imgui.h to ease sharing code between both branches. (#787)
- Nav: MainMenuBar now releases focus when user gets out of the menu layer. (#787)
- Nav: When applying focus to a window with only menus, the menu layer is automatically activated. (#787)
- Nav: Added `ImGuiNavInput_KeyMenu` (~Alt key) aside from ImGuiNavInput_PadMenu input as it is one differentiator of pad vs keyboard that was detrimental to the keyboard experience. Although isn't officially supported, it makes the current experience better. (#787)
- Nav: Move requests now wrap vertically inside Menus and Pop-ups. (#787)
- Nav: Allow to collapse tree nodes with NavLeft and open them with NavRight. (#787, #1079).
- Nav: It's now possible to navigate sibling of a menu-bar while navigating inside one of their child. If a Left<>Right navigation request fails to find a match we forward the request to the root menu. (#787, #126)
- Nav: Fixed `SetItemDefaultFocus` from stealing default focus when we are initializing default focus for a menu bar layer. (#787)
- Nav: Support for fall-back horizontal scrolling with PadLeft/PadRight (nb: fall-back scrolling is only used to navigate windows that have no interactive items). (#787)
- Nav: Fixed tool-tip from being selectable in the window selection list. (#787)
- Nav: `CollapsingHeader(bool*)` variant: fixed for `IsItemHovered()` not working properly in the nav branch. (#600, #787)
- Nav: InputText: Fixed using Up/Down history callback feature when Nav is enabled. (#787)
- Nav: InputTextMultiline: Fixed navigation/selection. Disabled selecting all when activating a multi-line text editor. (#787)
- Nav: More consistently drawing a (thin) navigation rectangle hover filled frames such as tree nodes, collapsing header, menus. (#787)
- Nav: Various internal refactoring.

 VERSION 1.51 (2017-08-24)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.51

Breaking Changes:

Work on dear imgui has been gradually resuming. It means that fixes and new features should be tackled at a faster rate than last year. However, in order to move forward with the library and get rid of some cruft, I have taken the liberty to be a little bit more aggressive than usual with API breaking changes. Read the details below and search for those names in your code! In the grand scheme of things, those changes are small and should not affect everyone, but this is technically our most aggressive release so far in term of API breakage. If you want to be extra forward-facing, you can enable `#define IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` in your imconfig.h to disable the obsolete names/redirection.

- Renamed `IsItemHoveredRect()` to `IsItemRectHovered()`. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed `IsMouseHoveringWindow()` to `IsWindowRectHovered()` for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed `IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow()` to `IsAnyWindowHovered()` for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed `ImGuiCol_Columns***` enums to `ImGuiCol_Separator***`. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
- Renamed `ImGuiSetCond***` types and enums to `ImGuiCond***`. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
- Renamed `GetStyleColName()` to `GetStyleColorName()` for consistency. Unlikely to be used by end-user!
- Added `PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol idx, ImU32 col)` overload, which _might_ cause an "ambiguous call" compilation error if you are using ImColor() with implicit cast. Cast to ImU32 or ImVec4 explicitly to fix.
- Marked the weird `IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME` helper macro as obsolete. Prefer using the more explicit `ImGuiOnceUponAFrame`.
- Changed `ColorEdit4(const char* label, float col[4], bool show_alpha = true)` signature to `ColorEdit4(const char* label, float col[4], ImGuiColorEditFlags flags = 0)`, where flags 0x01 is a safe no-op (hello dodgy backward compatibility!). The new `ColorEdit4`/`ColorPicker4` functions have lots of available flags! Check and run the demo window, under "Color/Picker Widgets", to understand the various new options.
- Changed signature of `ColorButton(ImVec4 col, bool small_height = false, bool outline_border = true)` to `ColorButton(const char* desc_id, ImVec4 col, ImGuiColorEditFlags flags = 0, ImVec2 size = ImVec2(0,0))`. This function was rarely used and was very dodgy (no explicit ID!).
- Changed `BeginPopupContextWindow(bool also_over_items=true, const char* str_id=NULL, int mouse_button=1)` signature to `(const char* str_id=NULL, int mouse_button=1, bool also_over_items=true)`. This is perhaps the most aggressive change in this update, but note that the majority of users relied on default parameters completely, so this will affect only a fraction of users of this already rarely used function.
- Removed `IsPosHoveringAnyWindow()`, which was partly broken and misleading. In the vast majority of cases, people using that function wanted to use `io.WantCaptureMouse` flag. Replaced with IM_ASSERT + comment redirecting user to `io.WantCaptureMouse`. (#1237)
- Removed the old `ValueColor()` helpers, they are equivalent to calling `Text(label)` + `SameLine()` + `ColorButton()`.
- Removed `ColorEditMode()` and `ImGuiColorEditMode` type in favor of `ImGuiColorEditFlags` and parameters to the various Color*() functions. The `SetColorEditOptions()` function allows to initialize default but the user can still change them with right-click context menu. Commenting out your old call to `ColorEditMode()` may just be fine!

Other Changes:

- Added flags to `ColorEdit3()`, `ColorEdit4()`. The color edit widget now has a context-menu and access to the color picker. (#346)
- Added flags to `ColorButton()`. (#346)
- Added `ColorPicker3()`, `ColorPicker4()`. The API along with those of the updated `ColorEdit4()` was designed so you may use them in various situation and hopefully compose your own picker if required. There are a bunch of available flags, check the Demo window and comment for `ImGuiColorEditFlags_`. Some of the options it supports are: two color picker types (hue bar + sat/val rectangle, hue wheel + rotating sat/val triangle), display as u8 or float, lifting 0.0..1.0 constraints (currently rgba only), context menus, alpha bar, background checkerboard options, preview tooltip, basic revert. For simple use, calling the existing `ColorEdit4()` function as you did before will be enough, as you can now open the color picker from there. (#346) [@r-lyeh, @nem0, @thennequin, @dariomanesku and @ocornut]
- Added `SetColorEditOptions()` to set default color options (e.g. if you want HSV over RGBA, float over u8, select a default picker mode etc. at startup time without a user intervention. Note that the user can still change options with the context menu unless disabled with `ImGuiColorFlags_NoOptions` or explicitly enforcing a display type/picker mode etc.).
- Added user-facing `IsPopupOpen()` function. (#891) [@mkeeter]
- Added `GetColorU32(u32)` variant that perform the style alpha multiply without a floating-point round trip, and helps makes code more consistent when using ImDrawList APIs.
- Added `PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol idx, ImU32 col)` overload.
- Added `GetStyleColorVec4(ImGuiCol idx)` which is equivalent to accessing `ImGui::GetStyle().Colors[idx]` (aka return the raw style color without alpha alteration).
- ImFontAtlas: Added `GlyphRangesBuilder` helper class, which makes it easier to build custom glyph ranges from your app/game localization data, or add into existing glyph ranges.
- ImFontAtlas: Added `TexGlyphPadding` option. (#1282) [@jadwallis]
- ImFontAtlas: Made it possible to override size of AddFontDefault() (even if it isn't really recommended!).
- ImDrawList: Added `GetClipRectMin()`, `GetClipRectMax()` helpers.
- Fixed Ini saving crash if the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoSavedSettings gets removed from a window after its creation (unlikely!). (#1000)
- Fixed `PushID()`/`PopID()` from marking parent window as Accessed (which needlessly woke up the root "Debug" window when used outside of a regular window). (#747)
- Fixed an assert when calling `CloseCurrentPopup()` twice in a row. [@nem0]
- Window size can be loaded from .ini data even if ImGuiWindowFlags_NoResize flag is set. (#1048, #1056)
- Columns: Added `SetColumnWidth()`. (#913) [@ggtucker]
- Columns: Dragging a column preserve its width by default. (#913) [@ggtucker]
- Columns: Fixed first column appearing wider than others. (#1266)
- Columns: Fixed allocating space on the right-most side with the assumption of a vertical scrollbar. The space is only allocated when needed. (#125, #913, #893, #1138)
- Columns: Fixed the right-most column from registering its content width to the parent window, which led to various issues when using auto-resizing window or e.g. horizontal scrolling. (#519, #125, #913)
- Columns: Refactored some of the columns code internally toward a better API (not yet exposed) + minor optimizations. (#913) [@ggtucker, @ocornut]
- Popups: Most pop-ups windows can be moved by the user after appearing (if they don't have explicit positions provided by caller, or e.g. sub-menu pop-up). The previous restriction was totally arbitrary. (#1252)
- Tooltip: `SetTooltip()` is expanded immediately into a window, honoring current font / styling setting. Add internal mechanism to override tooltips. (#862)
- PlotHistogram: bars are drawn based on zero-line, so negative values are going under. (#828)
- Scrolling: Fixed return values of `GetScrollMaxX()`, `GetScrollMaxY()` when both scrollbars were enabled. Tweak demo to display more data. (#1271) [@degracode]
- Scrolling: Fixes for Vertical Scrollbar not automatically getting enabled if enabled Horizontal Scrollbar straddle the vertical limit. (#1271, #246)
- Scrolling: `SetScrollHere()`, `SetScrollFromPosY()`: Fixed Y scroll aiming when Horizontal Scrollbar is enabled. (#665).
- [Windows] Clipboard: Fixed not closing Win32 clipboard on early open failure path. (#1264)
- Removed an unnecessary dependency on int64_t which failed on some older compilers.
- Demo: Rearranged everything under Widgets in a more consistent way.
- Demo: Columns: Added Horizontal Scrolling demo. Tweaked another Columns demo. (#519, #125, #913)
- Examples: OpenGL: Various makefiles for MINGW, Linux. (#1209, #1229, #1209) [@fr500, @acda]
- Examples: Enabled vsync by default in example applications, so it doesn't confuse people that the sample run at 2000+ fps and waste an entire CPU. (#1213, #1151).
- Various other small fixes, tweaks, comments, optimizations.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.50 (2017-06-02)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.50

Breaking Changes:

- Added a void* user_data parameter to Clipboard function handlers. (#875)
- SameLine(x) with x>0.0f is now relative to left of column/group if any, and not always to left of window. This was sort of always the intent and hopefully breakage should be minimal.
- Renamed ImDrawList::PathFill() - rarely used directly - to ImDrawList::PathFillConvex() for clarity and consistency.
- Removed ImFontConfig::MergeGlyphCenterV in favor of a more multipurpose ImFontConfig::GlyphOffset.
- Style: style.WindowTitleAlign is now a ImVec2 (ImGuiAlign enum was removed). set to (0.5f,0.5f) for horizontal+vertical centering, (0.0f,0.0f) for upper-left, etc.
- BeginChild(const char*) now applies the stack id to the provided label, consistently with other functions as it should always have been. It shouldn't affect you unless (extremely unlikely) you were appending multiple times to a same child from different locations of the stack id. If that's the case, generate an id with GetId() and use it instead of passing string to BeginChild().

Other Changes:

- BeginChild(const char*) now applies stack id to provided label, consistent with other widgets. (#894, #713)
- SameLine() with explicit X position is relative to left of group/columns. (ref #746, #125, #630)
- SliderInt(), SliderFloat() supports reverse direction (where v_min > v_max). (#854)
- SliderInt(), SliderFloat() better support for when v_min==v_max. (#919)
- SliderInt(), SliderFloat() enforces writing back value when interacting, to be consistent with other widgets. (#919)
- SliderInt, SliderFloat(): Fixed edge case where style.GrabMinSize being bigger than slider width can lead to a division by zero. (#919)
- Added IsRectVisible() variation with explicit start-end positions. (#768) [@thedmd]
- Fixed TextUnformatted() clipping bug in the large-text path when horizontal scroll has been applied. (#692, #246)
- Fixed minor text clipping issue in window title when using font straying above usual line. (#699)
- Fixed SetCursorScreenPos() fixed not adjusting CursorMaxPos as well.
- Fixed scrolling offset when using SetScrollY(), SetScrollFromPosY(), SetScrollHere() with menu bar.
- Fixed using IsItemActive() after EndGroup() or any widget using groups. (#840, #479)
- Fixed IsItemActive() lagging by one frame on initial widget activation. (#840)
- Fixed Separator() zero-height bounding box resulting in clipping when laying exactly on top line of clipping rectangle (#860)
- Fixed PlotLines() PlotHistogram() calling with values_count == 0.
- Fixed clicking on a window's void while staying still overzealously marking .ini settings as dirty. (#923)
- Fixed assert triggering when a window has zero rendering but has a callback. (#810)
- Scrollbar: Fixed rendering when sizes are negative to reduce glitches (which can happen with certain style settings and zero WindowMinSize).
- EndGroup(): Made IsItemHovered() work when an item was activated within the group. (#849)
- BulletText(): Fixed stopping to display formatted string after the '##' mark.
- Closing the focused window restore focus to the first active root window in descending z-order .(part of #727)
- Word-wrapping: Fixed a bug where we never wrapped after a 1 character word. [@sronsse]
- Word-wrapping: Fixed TextWrapped() overriding wrap position if one is already set. (#690)
- Word-wrapping: Fixed incorrect testing for negative wrap coordinates, they are perfectly legal. (#706)
- ImGuiListClipper: Fixed automatic-height calc path dumbly having user display element 0 twice. (#661, #716)
- ImGuiListClipper: Fix to behave within column. (#661, #662, #716)
- ImDrawList: Renamed ImDrawList::PathFill() to ImDrawList::PathFillConvex() for clarity. (BREAKING API)
- Columns: End() avoid calling Columns(1) if no columns set is open, not sure why it wasn't the case already (pros: faster, cons: exercise less code).
- ColorButton(): Fix ColorButton showing wrong hex value for alpha. (#1068) [@codecat]
- ColorEdit4(): better preserve inputting value out of 0..255 range, display then clamped in Hexadecimal form.

- ImFont: CalcWordWrapPositionA() fixed font scaling with fallback character.
- ImFont: Calculate and store the approximate texture surface to get an idea of how costly each source font is.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.49 (2016-05-09)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.49

Breaking Changes:

- Renamed `SetNextTreeNodeOpened()` to `SetNextTreeNodeOpen()` for consistency, no redirection.
- Removed confusing set of `GetInternalState()`, `GetInternalStateSize()`, `SetInternalState()` functions. Now using `CreateContext()`, `DestroyContext()`, `GetCurrentContext()`, `SetCurrentContext()`. If you were using multiple contexts the change should be obvious and trivial.
- Obsoleted old signature of `CollapsingHeader(const char* label, const char* str_id = NULL, bool display_frame = true, bool default_open = false)`, as extra parameters were badly designed and rarely used. Most uses were using 1 parameter and shouldn't affect you. You can replace the "default_open = true" flag in new API with `CollapsingHeader(label, ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DefaultOpen)`.
- Changed `ImDrawList::PushClipRect(ImVec4 rect)` to `ImDraw::PushClipRect(ImVec2 min,ImVec2 max,bool intersect_with_current_clip_rect=false)`. Note that higher-level `ImGui::PushClipRect()` is preferable because it will clip at logic/widget level, whereas `ImDrawList::PushClipRect()` only affect your renderer.
- Title bar (using ImGuiCol_TitleBg/ImGuiCol_TitleBgActive colors) isn't rendered over a window background (ImGuiCol_WindowBg color) anymore (see #655). If your TitleBg/TitleBgActive alpha was 1.0f or you are using the default theme it will not affect you. However if your TitleBg/TitleBgActive alpha was <1.0f you need to tweak your custom theme to readjust for the fact that we don't draw a WindowBg background behind the title bar.
  This helper function will convert an old TitleBg/TitleBgActive color into a new one with the same visual output, given the OLD color and the OLD WindowBg color. (Or If this is confusing, just pick the RGB value from title bar from an old screenshot and apply this as TitleBg/TitleBgActive. Or you may just create TitleBgActive from a tweaked TitleBg color.)

    ImVec4 ConvertTitleBgCol(const ImVec4& win_bg_col, const ImVec4& title_bg_col)
    {

 VERSION 1.48 (2016-04-09)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.48

Breaking Changes:

- Consistently honoring exact width passed to PushItemWidth() (when positive), previously it would add extra FramePadding.x*2 over that width. Some hand-tuned layout may be affected slightly. (#346)
- Style: removed `style.WindowFillAlphaDefault` which was confusing and redundant, baked alpha into `ImGuiCol_WindowBg` color. If you had a custom WindowBg color but didn't change WindowFillAlphaDefault, multiply WindowBg alpha component by 0.7. Renamed `ImGuiCol_TooltipBg` to `ImGuiCol_PopupBG`, applies to other types of pop-ups. `bg_alpha` parameter of 5-parameters version of Begin() is an override. (#337)
- InputText(): Added BufTextLen field in ImGuiTextEditCallbackData. Requesting user to update it if the buffer is modified in the callback. Added a temporary length-check assert to minimize panic for the 3 people using the callback. (#541)
- Renamed GetWindowFont() to GetFont(), GetWindowFontSize() to GetFontSize(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete). (#340)

- Combo(): Right-most button stays highlighted when pop-up is open.
- Combo(): Display pop-up above if there's isn't enough space below / or select largest side. (#505)
- DragFloat(), SliderFloat(), InputFloat(): fixed cases of erroneously returning true repeatedly after a text input modification (e.g. "0.0" --> "0.000" would keep returning true). (#564)
- DragFloat(): Always apply value when mouse is held/widget active, so that an always-reseting variable (e.g. non saved local) can be passed.
- InputText(): OS X friendly behaviors: Word movement uses ALT key; Shortcuts uses CMD key; Double-clicking text select a single word; Jumping to next word sets cursor to end of current word instead of beginning of current word. (@zhiayang), (#473)
- InputText(): Added BufTextLen in ImGuiTextEditCallbackData. Requesting user to maintain it if buffer is modified. Zero-ing structure properly before use. (#541)
- CheckboxFlags(): Added support for testing/setting multiple flags at the same time. (@DMartinek) (#555)
- TreeNode(), CollapsingHeader() fixed not being able to use "##" sequence in a formatted label.
- ColorEdit4(): Empty label doesn't add InnerSpacing.x, matching behavior of other widgets. (#346)
- ColorEdit4(): Removed unnecessary calls to scanf() when idle in hexadecimal edit mode.
- BeginPopupContextItem(), BeginPopupContextWindow(): added early out optimization.
- CaptureKeyboardFromApp() / CaptureMouseFromApp(): added argument to allow clearing the capture flag. (#533)

- Fixed compilation on DragonFly BSD (@mneumann) (#563)
- Examples: Vulkan: Added a Vulkan example (@Loftilus) (#549)
- Examples: DX10, DX11: Saving/restoring most device state so dropping render function in your codebase shouldn't have DX device side-effects. (#570)
- Examples: DX10, DX11: Fixed ImGui_ImplDX??_NewFrame() from recreating device objects if render isn't called (g_pVB not set).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.45 (2015-09-01)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.45

Breaking Changes:

- With the addition of better horizontal scrolling primitives I had to make some consistency fixes.
  `GetCursorPos()` `SetCursorPos()` `GetContentRegionMax()` `GetWindowContentRegionMin()` `GetWindowContentRegionMax()`
  are now incorporating the scrolling amount. They were incorrectly not incorporating this amount previously.
  It PROBABLY shouldn't break anything, but that depends on how you used them. Namely:
  - If you always used SetCursorPos() with values relative to GetCursorPos() there shouldn't be a problem.
    However if you used absolute coordinates, note that SetCursorPosY(100.0f) will put you at +100 from the initial Y position (which may be scrolled out of the view), NOT at +100 from the window top border. Since there wasn't any official scrolling value on X axis (past just manually moving the cursor) this can only affect you if you used to set absolute coordinates on the Y axis which is hopefully rare/unlikely, and trivial to fix.
  - The value of GetWindowContentRegionMax() isn't necessarily close to GetWindowWidth() if horizontally scrolling.
    Previously they were roughly interchangeable (roughly because the content region exclude window padding).

Other Changes:

- Added Horizontal Scrollbar via ImGuiWindowFlags_HorizontalScroll (#246).
- Added GetScrollX(), GetScrollX(), GetScrollMaxX() apis (#246).
- Added SetNextWindowContentSize(), SetNextWindowContentWidth() to explicitly set the content size of a window, which
  define the range of scrollbar. When set explicitly it also define the base value from which widget width are derived.
- Added IO.WantTextInput telling when ImGui is expecting text input, so that e.g. OS on-screen keyboard can be enabled.
- Added printf attribute to printf-like text formatting functions (Clang/GCC).
- Added GetMousePosOnOpeningCurrentPopup() helper.
- Added GetContentRegionAvailWidth() helper.
- Malformed UTF-8 data don't terminate string, output 0xFFFD instead (#307).
- ImDrawList: Added AddBezierCurve(), PathBezierCurveTo() API for cubic bezier curves (#311).
- ImDrawList: Allow to override ImDrawIdx type (#292).
- ImDrawList: Added an assert on overflowing index value (#292).
- ImDrawList: Fixed issues with channels split/merge. Now functional without manually adding a draw cmd. Added comments.
- ImDrawData: Added ScaleClipRects() helper useful when rendering scaled. (#287).
- Fixed Bullet() inconsistent layout behaviour when clipped.
- Fixed IsWindowHovered() not taking account of window hoverability (may be disabled because of a popup).
- Fixed InvisibleButton() not honoring negative size consistently with other widgets that do so.
- Fixed OpenPopup() accessing current window, effectively opening "Debug" when called from an empty window stack.
- TreeNode(): Fixed IsItemHovered() result being inconsistent with interaction visuals (#282).
- TreeNode(): Fixed mouse interaction padding past the node label being accounted for in layout (#282).
- BeginChild(): Passing a ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMove inhibits moving parent window from this child.
- BeginChild() fixed missing rounding for child sizes which leaked into layout and have items misaligned.
- Begin(): Removed default name = "Debug" parameter. We already have a "Debug" window pushed to the stack in the first place so it's not really a useful default.
- Begin(): Minor fixes with windows main clipping rectangle (e.g. child window with border).
- Begin(): Window flags are only read on the first call of the frame. Subsequent calls ignore flags, which allows appending to a window without worryin about flags.
- InputText(): ignore character input when ctrl/alt are held. (Normally those text input are ignored by most wrappers.) (#279).
- Demo: Fixed incorrectly formed string passed to Combo (#298).
- Demo: Added simple Log demo.
- Demo: Added horizontal scrolling example + enabled in console, log and child examples (#246).
- Style: made scrollbars rounded by default. Because nice. Minor menu bar background alpha tweak. (#246)
- Metrics: display indices along with triangles count (#299) and some internal state.
- ImGuiTextFilter::PassFilter() supports string range. Added [] helper to ImGuiTextBuffer.
- ImGuiTextFilter::Draw() default parameter width=0.0f for no override, allow override with negative values.
- Examples: OpenGL2/OpenGL3: fix for retina displays. Default font current lack crispness.
- Examples: OpenGL2/OpenGL3: save/restore more GL state correctly.
- Examples: DirectX9/DirectX11: resizing buffers dynamically (#299).
- Examples: DirectX9/DirectX11: added missing middle mouse button to Windows event handler.
- Examples: DirectX11: fix for Visual Studio 2015 presumably shipping with an updated version of DX11.
- Examples: iOS: fixed missing files in project.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.44 (2015-08-08)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.44

Breaking Changes:

- imgui.cpp has been split intro extra files: imgui_demo.cpp, imgui_draw.cpp, imgui_internal.h.
  Add the two extra .cpp to your project or #include them from another .cpp file. (#219)

Other Changes:

- Internal data structure and several useful functions are now exposed in imgui_internal.h. This should make it easier
  and more natural to extend ImGui. However please note that none of the content in imgui_internal.h is guaranteed
  for forward-compatibility and code using those types/functions may occasionally break. (#219)
- All sample code is in imgui_demo.cpp. Please keep this file in your project and consider allowing your code to call
  the ShowTestWindow() function as de-facto guide to ImGui features. It will be stripped out by the linker when unused.
- Added GetContentRegionAvail() helper (basically GetContentRegionMax() - GetCursorPos()).
- Added ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs for totally input-passthru window.
- Button(): honor negative size consistently with other widgets that do so (width -100 to align the button 100 pixels
  before the right-most position of the contents region).
- InputTextMultiline(): honor negative size consistently with other widgets that do so.
- Combo() clamp popup to lower edge of visible area.
- InputInt(): value doesn't pass through an int>float>int casting chain, fix handling lost of precision with "large" integer.
- InputInt() allow hexadecimal input (awkwardly via ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsHexadecimal but we will allow format
  string in InputInt* later).
- Checkbox(), RadioButton(): fixed scaling of checkbox and radio button for the filling of "active" visual.
- Columns: never assume horizontal space for scrollbar if NoScrollbar flag is explicitly set.
- Slider: fixed using FramePadding between frame and grab visual. Scaling that spacing would look odd.
- Fixed lower-right resize grip hit box not scaling along with its rendered size (#287)
- ImDrawList: Fixed angles in ImDrawList::PathArcTo(), PathArcToFast() (v1.43) being off by an extra PI for no reason.
- ImDrawList: Added ImDrawList::AddText() shorthand helper.
- ImDrawList: Add missing support for anti-aliased thick-lines (#133, also ref #288)
- ImFontAtlas: Added AddFontFromMemoryCompressedBase85TTF() to load base85 encoded font string. Default font encoded
  as base85 saves ~100 lines / 26 KB of source code. Added base85 output to the binary_to_compressed_c tool.
- Build fix for MinGW (#276).
- Examples: OpenGL3: Fixed running on script core profiles for OSX (#277).
- Examples: OpenGL3: Simplified code using glBufferData for vertices as well (#277, #278)
- Examples: DirectX11: Clear font texture view to ensure Release() doesn't get called twice (#290).
- Updated to stb_truetype 1.07 (back to vanilla version as our minor changes are now in master & fix unlikely assert
  with odd fonts (#280)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.43 (2015-07-17)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.43

Breaking Changes:

- This is a rather important release and we unfortunately had to break the rendering API.
  ImGui now requires you to render indexed vertices instead of non-indexed ones. The fix should be very easy.
  Sorry for that! This change is saving a fair amount of CPU/GPU and enables us to get anti-aliasing for a marginal cost.
  Each ImDrawList now contains both a vertex buffer and an index buffer. For each command, render ElemCount/3 triangles
  using indices from the index buffer.
- If you are using a vanilla copy of one of the imgui_impl_XXXX.cpp provided in the example, you just need to update
  your copy and you can ignore the rest.
- The signature of the io.RenderDrawListsFn handler has changed
  From:  ImGui_XXXX_RenderDrawLists(ImDrawList** const cmd_lists, int cmd_lists_count)
  To:    ImGui_XXXX_RenderDrawLists(ImDrawData* draw_data)
  With:  argument   'cmd_lists'        -> 'draw_data->CmdLists'
         argument   'cmd_lists_count'  -> 'draw_data->CmdListsCount'
         ImDrawList 'commands'         -> 'CmdBuffer'
         ImDrawList 'vtx_buffer'       -> 'VtxBuffer'
         ImDrawList  n/a               -> 'IdxBuffer' (new)
         ImDrawCmd  'vtx_count'        -> 'ElemCount'
         ImDrawCmd  'clip_rect'        -> 'ClipRect'
         ImDrawCmd  'user_callback'    -> 'UserCallback'
         ImDrawCmd  'texture_id'       -> 'TextureId'
- If you REALLY cannot render indexed primitives, you can call the draw_data->DeIndexAllBuffers() method to de-index
  the buffers. This is slow and a waste of CPU/GPU. Prefer using indexed rendering!
  Refer to code in the examples/ folder or ask on the GitHub if you are unsure of how to upgrade. Please upgrade!

Other Changes:

- Added anti-aliasing on lines and shapes based on primitives by @MikkoMononen (#133).
  Between the use of indexed-rendering and the fact that the entire rendering codebase has been optimized and massaged
  enough, with anti-aliasing enabled ImGui 1.43 is now running FASTER than 1.41.
  Made some extra effort in making the code run faster in your typical Debug build.
- Anti-aliasing can be disabled in the ImGuiStyle structure via the AntiAliasedLines/AntiAliasedShapes fields for further gains.
- ImDrawList: Added AddPolyline(), AddConvexPolyFilled() with optional anti-aliasing.
- ImDrawList: Added stateful path building and stroking API. PathLineTo(), PathArcTo(), PathRect(), PathFill(), PathStroke()
  with optional anti-aliasing.
- ImDrawList: Added AddRectFilledMultiColor() helper.
- ImDrawList: Added multi-channel rendering so out of order elements can be rendered in separate channels and then merged
  back together (used by columns).
- ImDrawList: Fixed merging draw commands when equal clip rectangles are in the two first commands.
- ImDrawList: Fixed window draw lists not destructed properly on Shutdown().
- ImDrawData: Added DeIndexAllBuffers() helper.
- Added lots of new font options ImFontAtlas::AddFont() and the new ImFontConfig structure.
  - Added support for oversampling (ImFontConfig: OversampleH, OversampleV) and sub-pixel positioning (ImFontConfig: PixelSnapH).
    Oversampling allows sub-pixel positioning but can also be used as a way to get some leeway with scaling fonts without re-rasterizing.
  - Added GlyphExtraSpacing option to add extra horizontal spacing between characters (#242).
  - Added MergeMode option to merge glyphs from different font inputs into a same font (#182, #232).
  - Added FontDataOwnedByAtlas option to keep ownership from the TTF data buffer and request the atlas to make a copy (#220).
- Updated to stb_truetype 1.06 (+ minor mods) with better font rasterization.
- InputText: Added ImGuiInputTextFlags_NoHorizontalScroll flag.
- InputText: Added ImGuiInputTextFlags_AlwaysInsertMode flag.
- InputText: Added HasSelection() helper in ImGuiTextEditCallbackData as a clarification.
- InputText: Fix for using END key on a multi-line text editor (#275)
- Columns: Dispatch render of each column in a sub-draw list and merge on closure, saving a lot of draw calls! (#125)
- Popups: Fixed Combo boxes inside menus. (#272)
- Style: Added GrabRounding setting to make the sliders etc. grabs rounded.
- Changed SameLine() parameters from int to float.
- Fixed incorrect assert triggering when code stole ActiveID from user moving a window by calling e.g. SetKeyboardFocusHere().
- Fixed CollapsingHeader() label rendering outside its frame in columns context where ClipRect max isn't aligned with the
  right-side of the header.
- Metrics window: calculate bounding box of actual vertices when hovering a draw list.
- Examples: Showing more information in the Fonts section.
- Examples: Added a gratuitous About window.
- Examples: Updated all examples code (OpenGL/DX9/DX11/SDL/Allegro/iOS) to use indexed rendering.
- Examples: Fixed the SDL2 example to support Unicode text input (#274).

 VERSION 1.42 (2015-07-08)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.42

Breaking Changes:

- Renamed SetScrollPosHere() to SetScrollHere(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
- Renamed GetScrollPosY() to GetScrollY(). Necessary to reduce confusion and make scrolling API consistent,
  because positions (e.g. cursor position) are not equivalent to scrolling amount.
- Removed obsolete GetDefaultFontData() function that would assert anyway.
  If you are updating from <1.30 you'll get a compile error instead of an assertion. (obsoleted 2015/01/11)

Other Changes:

- Added SDL2 example application (courtesy of @CedricGuillemet)
- Added iOS example application (courtesy of @joeld42)
- Added Allegro 5 example application (courtesy of @bggd)
- Added TitleBgActive color in style so focused window is made visible. (#253)
- Added CaptureKeyboardFromApp() / CaptureMouseFromApp() to manually enforce inputs capturing.
- Added DragFloatRange2() DragIntRange2() helpers. (#76)
- Added a Y centering ratio to SetScrollFromCursorPos() which can be used to aim the top or bottom of the window. (#150)
- Added SetScrollY(), SetScrollFromPos(), GetCursorStartPos() for manual scrolling manipulations. (#150).
- Added GetKeyIndex() helper for converting from ImGuiKey_\* enum to user's keycodes. Basically pulls from io.KeysMap[].
- Added missing ImGuiKey_PageUp, ImGuiKey_PageDown so more UI code can be written without referring to implementation-side keycodes.
- MenuItem() can be activated on release. (#245)
- Allowing NewFrame() with DeltaTime==0.0f to not assert.
- Fixed IsMouseDragging(). (#260)
- Fixed PlotLines(), PlotHistogram() using incorrect hovering test so they would show their tooltip even when there is
  a popup between mouse and the graph.
- Fixed window padding being reported incorrectly for child windows with borders when parent have no borders.
- Fixed a bug with TextUnformatted() clipping of long text blob when clipping y1 line sits on the first line of text. (#257)
- Fixed text baseline alignment of small button (no padding) after regular buttons.
- Fixed ListBoxHeader() not honoring negative sizes the same way as BeginChild() or BeginChildFrame(). (#263)
- Fixed warnings for more pedantic compiler settings (#258).
- ImVector<> cannot be re-defined anymore, cannot be replaced with std::vector<>. Allowed us to clean up and optimize
  lots of code. Yeah! (#262)
- ImDrawList: store pointer to their owner name for easier auditing/debugging.
- Examples: added scroll tracking example with SetScrollFromCursorPos().
- Examples: metrics windows render clip rectangle when hovering over a draw call.
- Lots of small optimization (particularly to run faster on unoptimized builds) and tidying up.
- Added font links in extra_fonts/ + instructions for using compressed fonts in C array.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.41 (2015-06-26)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.41

Breaking Changes:

- Changed ImageButton() default bg_col parameter from (0,0,0,1) (black) to (0,0,0,0) (transparent).
  Only makes a difference when texture have transparency.
- Changed Selectable() API from (label, selected, size) to (label, selected, flags, size).
  Size override should be used very rarely so hopefully it doesn't affect many people. Sorry!

Other Changes:

- Added InputTextMultiline() multi-line text editor, vertical scrolling, selection, optimized enough to handle rather
  big chunks of text in stateless context (thousands of lines are ok), option for allowing Tab to be input, option
  for validating with Return or Ctrl+Return (#200).
- Added modal window API, BeginPopupModal(), follows the popup api scheme. Modal windows can be closed by clicking
  outside. By default the rest of the screen is dimmed (using ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDarkening). Modal windows can be stacked.
- Added GetGlyphRangesCyrillic() helper (#237).
- Added SetNextWindowPosCenter() to center a window prior to knowing its size. (#249)
- Added IsWindowHovered() helper.
- Added IsMouseReleased(), IsKeyReleased() helpers to allow to user to avoid tracking them. (#248)
- Allow Set*WindowSize() calls to be used with popups.
- Window: AutoFit can be triggered on each axis separately via SetNextWindowSize(), etc.
- Window: fixed scrolling with mouse wheel while window was collapsed.
- Window: fixed mouse wheel scroll issues.
- DragFloat(), SliderFloat(): Fixed rounding of negative numbers which sometime made the negative lower bound unreachable.
- InputText(): lifted character count limit.
- InputText(): fixes in case of using per-window font scaling.
- Selectable(), MenuItem(): do not use frame rounding for hovering/selection.
- Selectable(): Added flag ImGuiSelectableFlags_DontClosePopups.
- Selectable(): Added flag ImGuiSelectableFlags_SpanAllColumns (#125).
- Combo(): Fixed issue with activating a Combo() not taking active id (#241).
- ColorButton(), ColorEdit4(): fix to ensure that the colored square stays square when non-default padding settings are used.
- BeginChildFrame(): returns bool like BeginChild() for clipping.
- SetScrollPosHere(): takes account of item height + more accurate centering + fixed precision issue.
- ImFont: ignoring '\r'.
- ImFont: added GetCharAdvance() helper. Exposed font Ascent and font Descent.
- ImFont: additional rendering optimizations.
- Metrics windows display storage size.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VERSION 1.40 (2015-05-31)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorated log: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.40

Breaking Changes:

- The BeginPopup() API (introduced in 1.37) had to be changed to allow for stacked popups and menus.
  Use OpenPopup() to toggle the opened state and BeginPopup() to append.**
- The third parameter of Button(), 'repeat_if_held' has been removed. While it's been very rarely used,
  some code will possibly break if you didn't rely on the default parameter.
  Use PushButtonRepeat()/PopButtonRepeat() to configure repeat.
- Renamed IsRectClipped() to !IsRectVisible() for consistency (opposite return value!). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete)
- Renamed GetWindowCollapsed() to IsWindowCollapsed() for consistency. Kept inline indirection function (will obsolete).

Other Changes:

- Menus: Added a menu system! Menus are typically populated with menu items and sub-menus, but you can add any sort of
  widgets in them (buttons, text inputs, sliders, etc.). (#126)
- Menus: Added MenuItem() to append a menu item. Optional shortcut display, acts a button & toggle with checked/unchecked state,
  disabled mode. Menu items can be used in any window.
- Menus: Added BeginMenu() to append a sub-menu. Note that you generally want to add sub-menu inside a popup or a menu-bar.
  They will work inside a normal window but it will be a bit unusual.
- Menus: Added BeginMenuBar() to append to window menu-bar (set ImGuiWindowFlags_MenuBar to enable).
- Menus: Added BeginMainMenuBar() helper to append to a fullscreen main menu-bar.
- Popups: Support for stacked popups. Each popup level inhibit inputs to lower levels. The menus system is based on this. (#126).
- Popups: Added BeginPopupContextItem(), BeginPopupContextWindow(), BeginPopupContextVoid() to create a popup window on mouse-click.
- Popups: Popups have borders by default (#197), attenuated border alpha in default theme.
- Popups & Tooltip: Fit within display. Handling various positioning/sizing/scrolling edge cases. Better hysteresis when moving
  in corners. Tooltip always tries to stay away from mouse-cursor.
- Added ImGuiStorage::GetVoidPtrRef() for manipulating stored void*.
- Added IsKeyDown() IsMouseDown() as convenience and for consistency with existing functions (instead of reading them from IO structures).
- Added Dummy() helper to advance layout by a given size. Unlike InvisibleButton() this doesn't catch any click.
- Added configurable io.KeyRepeatDelay, io.KeyRepeatRate keyboard and mouse repeat rate.
- Added PushButtonRepeat() / PopButtonRepeat() to enable hold-button-to-repeat press on any button.
- Removed the third 'repeat' parameter of Button().
- Added IsAnyItemHovered() helper.
- Added GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing() helper.
- Added ImGuiListClipper helper for clipping large list of evenly sized items, to avoid using CalcListClipping() directly.
- Separator: within group start on group horizontal offset. (#205)
- InputText: Fixed incorrect edit state after text buffer is appended to by user via the callback. (#206)
- InputText: CTRL+letter-key shortcuts (e.g. CTRL+C/V/X) makes sure only CTRL is pressed. (#214)
- InputText: Fixed cursor generating a zero-width wire-frame rectangle turning into a division by zero (would go unnoticed
  unless you trapped exceptions).
- InputFloatN/InputIntN: Flags parameter added to match scalar versions. (#218)
- Selectable: Horizontal filling not declared to ItemSize() so Selectable(),SameLine() works and we can better auto-fit the window.
- Selectable: Handling text baseline alignment for line that aren't of text height.
- Combo: Empty label doesn't add ItemInnerSpacing alignment, matching other widgets.
- EndGroup: Carries the text base offset from the last line of the group (sort of incorrect but better than nothing,
  should use the first line of the group, will implement in the future).
- Columns: distinguish columns-set ID from other widgets as a convenience, added asserts and sailors.
- ListBox: ListBox() function only use public API to encourage creating custom versions. ListBoxHeader() can return false.
- ListBox: Uses ImGuiListClipper and assume items of matching height, so large lists can be handled.
- Plot: overlay label clipped within frame when not fitting.
- Window: Added ImGuiSetCond_Appearing to test the hidden->visible transition in SetWindow***/SetNextWindow*** functions.
- Window: Auto-fitting cancel out one worth of vertical spacing for vertical symmetry (like what group and tooltip do).
- Window: Default item width for auto-resizing windows expressed as a factor of font height, scales better with different font.
- Window: Fixed auto-fit calculation mismatch of whether a scrollbar will be added by maximum height clamping. Also honor NoScrollBar in the case of height clamping, not adding extra horizontal space.
- Window: Hovering require to hover same child window. Reverted 860cf57 (December 3). Might break something if you have
  child overlapping items in parent window.
- Window: Fixed appending multiple times to an existing child via multiple BeginChild/EndChild calls to same child name.
  Allows a simple form of out-of-order appending.
- Window: Fixed auto-filling child window using WindowMinSize at their minimum size, irrelevant.
- Metrics: Added io.MetricsActiveWindows counter. (#213.
- Metrics: Added io.MetricsAllocs counter (number of active memory allocations).
- Metrics: ShowMetricsWindow() shows popups stack, allocations.
- Style: Added style.DisplayWindowPadding to prevent windows from reaching edges of display (similar to style.DisplaySafeAreaPadding which is still in effect and also affect popups/tooltips).
- Style: Removed style.AutoFitPadding, using style.WindowPadding makes more sense (the default values were already the same).
- Style: Added style.ScrollbarRounding. (#212)
- Style: Added ImGuiCol_TextDisabled for disabled text. Added TextDisabled() helper.
- Style: Added style.WindowTitleAlign alignment options, to e.g. center title on windows. (#222)
- ImVector: tweak growth strategy, matches vector from VS2010.
- ImFontAtlas: Added ClearFonts(), making the different clear funcs more explicit. (#224)
- ImFontAtlas: Fixed appending new fonts without clearing existing fonts. Clearing input data left to application. (#224)
- ImDrawList: Merge draw command better, cases of multiple Begin/End gets merged properly.
- Store common stacked settings contiguously in memory to avoid heap allocation for unused features, and reduce cache misses.
- Shutdown() tests for g.IO.Fonts not being NULL to ease use of multiple ImGui contexts. (#207)
- Added IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS define to disable the functions that are meant to be removed.
- Examples: Added ? marks with tooltips next to various widgets. Added more comments in the demo window.
- Examples: Added Menu-bar example.
- Examples: Added Simple Layout example.
- Examples: AutoResize demo doesn't use TextWrapped().
- Examples: Console example uses standard malloc/free, makes more sense as a copy & pastable example.
- Examples: DirectX9/11: Fixed key mapping for down arrow.
- Examples: DirectX9/11: hide OS cursor if ImGui is drawing it. (#155)
- Examples: DirectX11: explicitly set rasterizer state.
- Examples: OpenGL3: Add conditional compilation of forward compat as required by glfw on OSX. (#229)
- Fixed build with Visual Studio 2008 (possibly earlier versions as well).
- Other fixes, comments, tweaks.
