### The Pitch

Dear ImGui is a **bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++**. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to **enable fast iterations** and to **empower programmers** to create **content creation tools and visualization / debug tools** (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries. Among other things, full internationalization (right-to-left text, bidirectional text, text shaping etc.) and accessibility features are not supported.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in game engines (for tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded applications, or any applications on console platforms where operating system features are non-standard.

 - Minimize state synchronization.
 - Minimize UI-related state storage on user side.
 - Minimize setup and maintenance.
 - Easy to use to create dynamic UI which are the reflection of a dynamic data set.
 - Easy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.
 - Easy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived, more elaborate tools.
 - Easy to hack and improve.
 - Portable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones, etc.).
 - Efficient runtime and memory consumption.
 - Battle-tested, used by [many major actors in the game industry](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Software-using-dear-imgui).

### Usage

**The core of Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few platform-agnostic files** which you can easily compile in your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (imgui*.cpp, imgui*.h). **No specific build process is required**. You can add the .cpp files into your existing project.

**Backends for a variety of graphics API and rendering platforms** are provided in the [backends/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends) folder, along with example applications in the [examples/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples) folder. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear ImGui.

See the [Getting Started & Integration](#getting-started--integration) section of this document for more details.

After Dear ImGui is set up in your application, you can use it from \_anywhere\_ in your program loop:
```cpp
ImGui::Text("Hello, world %d", 123);
if (ImGui::Button("Save"))
    MySaveFunction();
ImGui::InputText("string", buf, IM_ARRAYSIZE(buf));
ImGui::SliderFloat("float", &f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
```

![sample code output (light, segoeui font, freetype)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/191050838-8742efd4-504d-4334-a9a2-e756d15bc2ab.png)

```cpp
// Create a window called "My First Tool", with a menu bar.
ImGui::Begin("My First Tool", &my_tool_active, ImGuiWindowFlags_MenuBar);
if (ImGui::BeginMenuBar())
{
    if (ImGui::BeginMenu("File"))
    {
        if (ImGui::MenuItem("Open..", "Ctrl+O")) { /* Do stuff */ }
        if (ImGui::MenuItem("Save", "Ctrl+S"))   { /* Do stuff */ }
        if (ImGui::MenuItem("Close", "Ctrl+W"))  { my_tool_active = false; }
        ImGui::EndMenu();
    }
    ImGui::EndMenuBar();
}

// Edit a color stored as 4 floats
ImGui::ColorEdit4("Color", my_color);

// Generate samples and plot them
float samples[100];
for (int n = 0; n < 100; n++)
    samples[n] = sinf(n * 0.2f + ImGui::GetTime() * 1.5f);
ImGui::PlotLines("Samples", samples, 100);

// Display contents in a scrolling region
ImGui::TextColored(ImVec4(1,1,0,1), "Important Stuff");
ImGui::BeginChild("Scrolling");
for (int n = 0; n < 50; n++)
    ImGui::Text("%04d: Some text", n);
ImGui::EndChild();
ImGui::End();
```
![my_first_tool_v188](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/191055698-690a5651-458f-4856-b5a9-e8cc95c543e2.gif)

Dear ImGui allows you to **create elaborate tools** as well as very short-lived ones. On the extreme side of short-livedness: using the Edit&Continue (hot code reload) feature of modern compilers you can add a few widgets to tweak variables while your application is running, and remove the code a minute later! Dear ImGui is not just for tweaking values. You can use it to trace a running algorithm by just emitting text commands. You can use it along with your own reflection data to browse your dataset live. You can use it to expose the internals of a subsystem in your engine, to create a logger, an inspection tool, a profiler, a debugger, an entire game-making editor/framework, etc.

### How it works

The IMGUI paradigm through its API tries to minimize superfluous state duplication, state synchronization, and state retention from the user's point of view. It is less error-prone (less code and fewer bugs) than traditional retained-mode interfaces, and lends itself to creating dynamic user interfaces. Check out the Wiki's [About the IMGUI paradigm](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm) section for more details.

Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and command lists that you can easily render in your application. The number of draw calls and state changes required to render them is fairly small. Because Dear ImGui doesn't know or touch graphics state directly, you can call its functions  anywhere in your code (e.g. in the middle of a running algorithm, or in the middle of your own rendering process). Refer to the sample applications in the examples/ folder for instructions on how to integrate Dear ImGui with your existing codebase.

_A common misunderstanding is to mistake immediate mode GUI for immediate mode rendering, which usually implies hammering your driver/GPU with a bunch of inefficient draw calls and state changes as the GUI functions are called. This is NOT what Dear ImGui does. Dear ImGui outputs vertex buffers and a small list of draw calls batches. It never touches your GPU directly. The draw call batches are decently optimal and you can render them later, in your app or even remotely._

### Releases & Changelogs

See [Releases](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases) page for decorated Changelogs.
Reading the changelogs is a good way to keep up to date with the things Dear ImGui has to offer, and maybe will give you ideas of some features that you've been ignoring until now!

### Demo

Calling the `ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()` function will create a demo window showcasing a variety of features and examples. The code is always available for reference in `imgui_demo.cpp`. [Here's how the demo looks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ocornut/imgui/web/v167/v167-misc.png).

You should be able to build the examples from sources. If you don't, let us know! If you want to have a quick look at some Dear ImGui features, you can download Windows binaries of the demo app here:
- [imgui-demo-binaries-20241211.zip](https://www.dearimgui.com/binaries/imgui-demo-binaries-20241211.zip) (Windows, 1.91.6, built 2024/11/11, master) or [older binaries](https://www.dearimgui.com/binaries).

The demo applications are not DPI aware so expect some blurriness on a 4K screen. For DPI awareness in your application, you can load/reload your font at a different scale and scale your style with `style.ScaleAllSizes()` (see [FAQ](https://www.dearimgui.com/faq)).

### Getting Started & Integration

See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started) guide for details.

On most platforms and when using C++, **you should be able to use a combination of the [imgui_impl_xxxx](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends) backends without modification** (e.g. `imgui_impl_win32.cpp` + `imgui_impl_dx11.cpp`). If your engine supports multiple platforms, consider using more imgui_impl_xxxx files instead of rewriting them: this will be less work for you, and you can get Dear ImGui running immediately. You can _later_ decide to rewrite a custom backend using your custom engine functions if you wish so.

Integrating Dear ImGui within your custom engine is a matter of 1) wiring mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs 2) uploading a texture to your GPU/render engine 3) providing a render function that can bind textures and render textured triangles, which is essentially what Backends are doing. The [examples/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples) folder is populated with applications doing just that: setting up a window and using backends. If you follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started) guide it should in theory takes you less than an hour to integrate Dear ImGui.  **Make sure to spend time reading the [FAQ](https://www.dearimgui.com/faq), comments, and the examples applications!**

**Which version should I get?**

We occasionally tag [Releases](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases) (with nice releases notes) but it is generally safe and recommended to sync to latest `master` or `docking` branch. The library is fairly stable and regressions tend to be fixed fast when reported. Advanced users may want to use the `docking` branch with [Multi-Viewport](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Multi-Viewports) and [Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Docking) features. This branch is kept in sync with master regularly.

Omar: "I first discovered the IMGUI paradigm at [Q-Games](https://www.q-games.com) where Atman Binstock had dropped his own simple implementation in the codebase, which I spent quite some time improving and thinking about. It turned out that Atman was exposed to the concept directly by working with Casey. When I moved to Media Molecule I rewrote a new library trying to overcome the flaws and limitations of the first one I've worked with. It became this library and since then I have spent an unreasonable amount of time iterating and improving it."
