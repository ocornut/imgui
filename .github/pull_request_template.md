- Please read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md
- Please understand that by submitting a PR you are also submitting a request for the maintainer to review your code and then take over its maintenance forever. PR should be crafted both in the interest in the end-users and also to ease the maintainer into understanding and accepting it.
- When adding a feature, please describe the usage context (how you intend to use it, why you need it, etc.).
- When adding a feature, try to attach screenshots/gifs to clarify the context and demonstrate the feature at a glance.
- When fixing a warning or compilation problem, post the compiler log and specify the version and OS you are using.
- Make sure your code follows the coding style already used in the codebase (4 spaces identation, no tabs, `type* name`, `local_variable`, `FunctionName()`, `MemberName`, `// Text Comment`, `//CodeComment()`, etc.). We don't use modern C++ idioms, we don't use C++ style cast, we don't use C++ headers, and we can compile without a C++11 compatible compiler.
- Make sure you create a branch for the pull request. In Git, 1 PR is associated to 1 branch. If you keep pushing to the same branch after you submitted the PR, your new commits will appear in the PR.
